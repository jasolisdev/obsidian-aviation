# PHAK Chapters 11 & 12: Weather Theory & Services

Weather is the biggest variable in aviation. Chapter 11 explains *why* weather happens (Theory), and Chapter 12 explains *how* we find out about it (Services).

## Key Concepts
- **Theory:** Atmosphere stability, Fronts (Cold/Warm), Clouds, Fog, Turbulence, Icing.
- **Services:** METAR, TAF, PIREP, AIRMET/SIGMET, Surface Analysis Charts.

## Study Notes
- [[04-Weather/Notes/Atmosphere-Stability-Lapse-Rate|Atmosphere & Stability]]: Why hot air rises and creates storms.
- [[04-Weather/Notes/Clouds-Fronts-Hazards|Clouds, Fronts, & Hazards]]: Identifying the danger.
- [[04-Weather/Notes/METAR-TAF-Interpretation|METAR & TAF]]: Reading the code.
- [[04-Weather/Notes/In-Flight-Weather-Advisories|AIRMETs & SIGMETs]]: The warnings you can't ignore.

## Checkride Focus
- **Go/No-Go:** "Here is a METAR. Can you fly VFR?"
- **Thunderstorms:** The 3 stages (Cumulus, Mature, Dissipating).
- **Fog:** Radiation vs. Advection fog.
