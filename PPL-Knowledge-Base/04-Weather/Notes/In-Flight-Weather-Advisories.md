# In-Flight Weather Advisories

## Definition
Bulletins issued to warn pilots of hazardous weather.

## 1. AIRMET (WA)
**"Airman's Meteorological Information"**
- Intended for smaller aircraft (like us).
- Issued every 6 hours.
- Three Types:
    - **Sierra (S):** IFR conditions / Mountain Obscuration.
    - **Tango (T):** Turbulence (Moderate), winds > 30 kts.
    - **Zulu (Z):** Icing (Moderate).

## 2. SIGMET (WS)
**"Significant Meteorological Information"**
- Severe weather affecting **all** aircraft.
- Severe Icing, Severe Turbulence, Dust storms, Volcanic Ash.
- Unscheduled (issued when needed), valid 4 hours.

## 3. Convective SIGMET (WST)
- The bad stuff.
- Tornadoes, Lines of Thunderstorms, Hail > 3/4 inch, Gusts > 50 kts.
- Issued for *any* thunderstorm activity implying severe/greater turbulence, severe icing, and low-level wind shear.

## Checkride Angle
- **Question:** "What's the difference between AIRMET Zulu and a SIGMET for icing?"
- **Answer:** AIRMET Zulu is for *Moderate* icing. A SIGMET is for *Severe* icing.
- **Scenario:** "Can you fly into an area with an AIRMET Tango?"
- **Answer:** Legally, yes. Smartly? Maybe not. It means moderate turbulence.

## Study Drills
1. Which AIRMET covers IFR conditions? (Sierra - think "Stuff blocking vision").
2. Does a SIGMET apply to Airliners? (Yes, it applies to everyone).
