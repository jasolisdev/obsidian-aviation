# Atmosphere Stability & Lapse Rate

## Definition
**Stability** is the atmosphere's resistance to vertical motion.
- **Stable Air:** Resists upward movement. If pushed up, it sinks back down.
- **Unstable Air:** Enhances upward movement. If pushed up, it keeps going (creating storms).

## Lapse Rate
The rate at which temperature decreases with altitude.
- **Standard:** 2°C per 1,000 ft.
- **Unstable:** > 2°C (Air cools fast aloft, so warm surface air rises rapidly).
- **Inversion:** Temperature *increases* with altitude. Very stable. Traps fog/smog.

## Characteristics (Memorize This Table)

| Feature | Stable Air | Unstable Air |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clouds** | Stratiform (Flat, layered) | Cumuliform (Puffy, vertical) |
| **Turbulence** | Smooth | Rough (Bumpy) |
| **Precipitation** | Steady, continuous | Showery, intense |
| **Visibility** | Poor (Fog, Haze) | Good (Wind clears it out) |

## Checkride Angle
- **Scenario:** "You see stratus clouds and it's hazy. Is the air stable or unstable?"
- **Answer:** Stable.
- **Scenario:** "What causes a thunderstorm?"
- **Answer:** Unstable air + Moisture + Lifting Action.

    Sink --> Flat[Stratus/Clear]
```

## Study Drills
1. What kind of visibility do you expect in stable air? (Poor/Haze).
2. What is a temperature inversion? (Temp rises with altitude; very stable).
