# Private Pilot Privileges & Limitations

## What it is
The private pilot certificate (single-engine land) authorizes you to act as pilot in command of an aircraft carrying passengers or cargo for non-commercial purposes, given you meet the currency and medical requirements in FAR Part 61.

## Why it matters
Knowing your privileges keeps you legal and aligned with the DPE’s expectation that you can explain what you can and cannot do immediately after the checkride.

## How it shows up on a checkride
- **Q:** “What can you do with your private pilot certificate?” **A:** Carry passengers or cargo for most purposes, but not for hire except for certain cost-sharing where you meet FAR 61.113(c).
- **Q:** “Can you fly at night after the checkride?” **A:** Only if you complete the night currency requirements in FAR 61.57.
- **Q:** “What’s required to show and carry passengers?” **A:** 3 takeoffs and landings in the same category/class within 90 days; new night class to carry passengers at night.

## Common mistakes
- Confusing “for hire” with “for compensation.” The private pilot must not accept money for the flight service itself.
- Forgetting to log and re-find currency requirements before flying passengers.
- Ignoring the requirement to give passengers the weight & balance/limitations briefing.
