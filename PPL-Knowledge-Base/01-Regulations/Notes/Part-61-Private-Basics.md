# Private Pilot Privileges & Limitations

## What it is
For airplane single-engine land, Part 61 defines eligibility, testing, and the privileges/limitations of a private pilot certificate.

## Core rules you must know
- `61.103`: eligibility requirements (age, English, aeronautical knowledge/experience).
- `61.113`: private pilot privileges and compensation/hire limitations.
- `61.56`: flight review requirement (24 calendar months).
- `61.57`: recent flight experience to carry passengers.

## Checkride angle
- Private pilots may carry passengers and share direct operating expenses on a pro-rata basis when legal.
- Private pilots may not act as PIC for compensation or hire except listed exceptions in `61.113`.
- Passenger currency and flight review currency are separate legal requirements.

## Common mistakes
- Citing `61.103` as the privileges section (it is eligibility).
- Treating passenger-currency landings as equivalent to flight review currency.
- Assuming any money exchange is illegal; the rule depends on the specific exception and conditions.
