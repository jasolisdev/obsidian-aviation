# Right-of-Way Rules

## What it is
`91.113` defines right-of-way priorities and collision-avoidance responsibilities for aircraft in flight and on approach/landing.

## Core rules
- Head-on: both aircraft alter course to the right.
- Converging (same altitude): aircraft to the other's right has right-of-way.
- Overtaking: overtaking aircraft must keep well clear.
- Landing: aircraft on final or landing have right-of-way, but may not force in front of another already established.
- Category priority (in general): power-driven aircraft yield to balloons, gliders, and aircraft towing/refueling in flight.

## Checkride angle
Examiners focus on applied scenarios in pattern and uncontrolled-airport operations, not memorization alone.

## Common mistakes
- Assuming right-of-way removes your collision-avoidance duty.
- Descending into wake/conflict during overtakes.
- Forcing unstable pattern entries instead of extending/go-around.
