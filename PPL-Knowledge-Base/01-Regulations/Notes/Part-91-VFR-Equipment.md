# Part 91 VFR Rules and Equipment

## Core sections to master
- `91.103` preflight action.
- `91.151` VFR fuel reserve requirements.
- `91.155` VFR weather minima.
- `91.205` required instruments/equipment.
- `91.213` inoperative equipment process.

## Why it matters
These are the most frequently tested legal foundations in PPL oral exams and practical preflight scenario questions.

## Fast preflight legal checklist
1. Weather minima legal for route/airspace/time.
2. Fuel legal plus personal reserve margin.
3. Required equipment operative (or valid INOP process complete).
4. ARROW and pilot documents in order.

## Common mistakes
- Quoting mnemonics without regulation context.
- Missing night-specific items and requirements.
- Assuming all installed equipment is required for dispatch.
