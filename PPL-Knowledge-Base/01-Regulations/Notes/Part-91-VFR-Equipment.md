# FAR Part 91 VFR Rules and Equipment

## What it is
Part 91 gates the operational picture for every non-commercial VFR flight. It defines minimum VFR weather and fuel requirements, right-of-way rules, and the equipment you must have installed and working.

## Why it matters
A DPE expects you to state the legal weather minimums and mandatory equipment before flight. That keeps every plan and briefing tied to safety-critical limits.

## How it shows up on a checkride
- **Q:** “What are the day VFR minimums for Class G below 1,200 AGL?” **A:** 1 statute mile visibility, clear of clouds (FAR 91.155).
- **Q:** “What instruments/equipment are required for VFR day?” **A:** ATOMATOFLAMES (Altimeter, Tachometer, Oil temp, Manifold pressure, Airspeed, Temperature gauge, Oil pressure, Fuel gauge, Landing gear light, Anticolission, Magnetic compass, Emergency equipment, Seat belts).
- **Q:** “What is the fuel requirement before takeoff?” **A:** 30 minutes of fuel reserve for day VFR (FAR 91.151).

## Common mistakes
- Reading Class G minimums as if they apply to Class E—always check the sectional or chart supplement to verify.
- Trusting a single instrument gauge without cross-checking duplicates (a fuel gauge failure is a fatal trap).
- Assuming equipment list applies to your aircraft; verify the POH/FAR 91.205 for mandated items.
