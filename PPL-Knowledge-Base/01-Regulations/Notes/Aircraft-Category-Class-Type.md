# Aircraft Category, Class, & Type

## Definition
The FAA uses the same words—Category and Class—to mean different things depending on whether they are talking about the **AIRMEN** (you) or the **AIRCRAFT** (the machine).

## Why It Matters
You need to know what you are rated to fly. A "Rotorcraft" is a category of airmen certification, but "Normal" is a category of aircraft certification.

## The Distinction

| Context | **Category** (Broad) | **Class** (Specific) | **Type** (Very Specific) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AIRMEN** (Your License) | Airplane, Rotorcraft, Glider, Lighter-than-Air | Single-Engine Land (SEL), Multi-Engine Land (MEL), Helicopter | Specific make/model if >12,500 lbs or jet (e.g., B-737) |
| **AIRCRAFT** (Airworthiness) | Normal, Utility, Acrobatic, Transport | Airplane, Rotorcraft, Glider | Same as above |

> [!TIP] Memory Aid
> **"Resepct Airmen Privileges"**
> When talking about **you** (Airmen), Category is broad like **Airplane**.
> When talking about the **machine** (Aircraft), Category is intended use like **Normal** or **Utility**.

## Checkride Angle
- **Question:** "What is the Category and Class of your pilot certificate?"
- **Answer:** Category: Airplane. Class: Single-Engine Land.
- **Question:** "What is the Category and Class of this C172 according to its Airworthiness Certificate?"
- **Answer:** Category: Normal (or Utility). Class: Airplane.

## Common Mistakes
- Swapping the definitions.
- Thinking "Single-Engine Land" is a category. It is a class.

    Class2 --> Type2[Type: B-737 (Type Rating Req)]
```

## Study Drills
1. Does a Cessna 172 require a Type Rating? Why?
2. What "Class" allows you to fly a seaplane?
3. If you take your checkride in a single-engine plane, can you fly a multi-engine plane?
