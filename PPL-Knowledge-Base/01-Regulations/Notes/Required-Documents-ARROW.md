# Required Documents (ARROW)

## What it is
`ARROW` is the standard onboard aircraft-document memory aid:
- Airworthiness certificate
- Registration certificate
- Radio station license (when required, typically international ops)
- Operating limitations (POH/AFM and placards)
- Weight and balance information

## Pilot document reminder
As pilot, also be ready to show:
- Photo ID
- Pilot certificate
- Medical certificate or BasicMed qualification as applicable (`61.3`)

## Checkride angle
You should quickly distinguish between documents that must be in the aircraft and documents that must be in your possession.

## Common mistakes
- Treating radio station license as always required domestically.
- Forgetting placards/limitations are part of required operating limitations.
- Not verifying current W&B documentation after modifications.
