# VFR Weather Minimums (91.155)

## What it is
`91.155` sets legal VFR visibility and cloud clearance minima by airspace, altitude, and day/night condition.

## Quick reference

| Airspace | Visibility | Cloud clearance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Class B | 3 SM | Clear of clouds |
| Class C / D / E below 10,000 MSL | 3 SM | 500 below, 1,000 above, 2,000 horizontal |
| Class E at/above 10,000 MSL | 5 SM | 1,000 below, 1,000 above, 1 SM horizontal |
| Class G day below 1,200 AGL | 1 SM | Clear of clouds |
| Class G night below 1,200 AGL | 3 SM | 500 below, 1,000 above, 2,000 horizontal |
| Class G day below 10,000 MSL but above 1,200 AGL | 1 SM | 500 below, 1,000 above, 2,000 horizontal |
| Class G night below 10,000 MSL but above 1,200 AGL | 3 SM | 500 below, 1,000 above, 2,000 horizontal |
| Class G at/above 10,000 MSL (day/night) | 5 SM | 1,000 below, 1,000 above, 1 SM horizontal |

## Special VFR reminder
`91.157`: typically requires ATC clearance, 1 SM visibility, and clear of clouds; additional night limitations apply.

## Common mistakes
- Not checking whether cloud layer altitudes are AGL vs MSL.
- Applying Class G minima to Class E operations.
- Forgetting 10,000 MSL rule changes for E/G.
