# Equipment Requirements & INOP Equipment

## What it is
- `91.205`: required instruments/equipment for day and night VFR.
- `91.213`: legal process to operate with inoperative equipment.

## Day and night mnemonics
- Day VFR (`91.205(b)`): often remembered as `ATOMATOFLAMES`.
- Night VFR adds (`91.205(c)`): often remembered as `FLAPS`.

## INOP decision flow (`91.213`)
1. Determine whether the inoperative item is required by:
   - Type design / KOEL / equipment list,
   - AD,
   - `91.205` or any other rule for the operation.
2. If not required, deactivate or remove (as appropriate) and placard `INOP`.
3. If maintenance action is required, it must be performed and recorded properly.
4. If the aircraft has an MEL, follow the MEL procedures.

## Checkride angle
You should be able to walk a DPE through one real scenario from your trainer (for example, an inoperative landing light for a daytime Part 91 flight).

## Common mistakes
- Flying with known inoperative required equipment.
- Placarding without proper deactivation/maintenance steps when needed.
- Using mnemonic memory only without checking POH/equipment list context.
