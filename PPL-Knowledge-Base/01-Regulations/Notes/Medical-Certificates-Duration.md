# Medical Certificates & BasicMed

## What it is
You need an appropriate medical pathway to act as PIC: FAA medical certificate or BasicMed (if eligible and within limitations).

## Medical duration basics (end of month rule)

| Age at exam | 1st class ATP privileges | 2nd class commercial privileges | 3rd class private privileges |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Under 40 | 12 calendar months | 12 calendar months | 60 calendar months |
| 40 or older | 6 calendar months | 12 calendar months | 24 calendar months |

## BasicMed essentials
- Must have held a valid FAA medical after July 14, 2006.
- Complete CMEC exam every 48 months.
- Complete online course every 24 months.
- Operational limits include: max 6 seats, max 6,000 lb certificated takeoff weight, max 250 KIAS, below 18,000 MSL, generally within U.S. unless another country accepts BasicMed.

## Checkride angle
Be ready to explain certificate validity, downgrade of privileges by operation type, and the self-grounding rule in `61.53`.

## Common mistakes
- Forgetting validity runs to the end of the month.
- Confusing medical certificate class with the operation you are conducting.
- Ignoring `61.53` self-grounding obligations.
