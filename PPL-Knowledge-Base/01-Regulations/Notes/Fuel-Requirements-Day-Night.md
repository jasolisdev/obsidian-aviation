# Fuel Requirements (Day/Night VFR)

## What it is
FAR 91.151 requires that for VFR flight you have enough fuel to reach your first point of intended landing plus a reserve: 30 minutes during the day and 45 minutes at night, all at normal cruising speed.

## Why it matters
Fuel planning is one of the easiest regulatory checks to fail; a DPE will expect you to show your math and explain how you handle unplanned delays or headwinds without dipping into the reserves.

## How it shows up on a checkride
- **Q:** “How much fuel must you have before taking off on a day VFR cross-country?” **A:** Fuel to fly to the first airport plus 30 minutes reserve at normal cruise.
- **Q:** “What changes if you plan a night flight?” **A:** Increase reserves to 45 minutes at normal cruise speed.
- **Q:** “What do you do if headwinds make you question your reserve?” **A:** Recalculate, possibly delay or reduce payload, and always land with the published reserve intact.

## Common mistakes
- Using fuel gauges as the only source without cross-checking fuel burn on the ground.
- Ignoring the new reserve after diverting or holding—once you burn fuel, recompute to ensure the reserve remains.
- Not accounting for taxi/takeoff/climb fuel when planning the total end-of-flight fuel.
