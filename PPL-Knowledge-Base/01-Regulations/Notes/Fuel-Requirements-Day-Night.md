# Fuel Requirements (Day/Night VFR)

## What it is
For VFR under `91.151`, you must have enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing and then:
- `Day`: at least 30 minutes at normal cruise.
- `Night`: at least 45 minutes at normal cruise.

## Checkride angle
DPEs typically test whether you can connect legal minimum reserve to actual planning (taxi, climb, forecast winds, reroute margin, and alternate options).

## Common mistakes
- Planning exactly to legal minimum with no practical margin.
- Forgetting fuel burn for taxi/climb/holding.
- Not recomputing reserve after route/weather changes.

## Practical standard
Legal minimum is a floor. Many instructors recommend larger personal reserves (for example, 60+ minutes day and more at night) based on mission and conditions.
