# Endorsements & Currency

## What it is
- Endorsements: instructor authorizations required for specific training/operations.
- Currency: legal recent-experience requirements to exercise privileges.

## Key currency rules
- `61.56`: flight review every 24 calendar months.
- `61.57(a)`: 3 takeoffs/landings in preceding 90 days for passenger carriage (same category/class/type if required).
- `61.57(b)`: night passenger currency requires full-stop landings in the night window.

## Key endorsement examples
- Student solo and solo XC endorsements (`61.87`, `61.93`).
- High-performance, complex, tailwheel, high-altitude endorsements (`61.31`).

## Checkride angle
Be ready to separate:
1. What endorsement you needed to train or operate.
2. Whether you are currently legal to carry passengers.
3. Whether you are practically proficient for current conditions.

## Common mistakes
- Mixing up flight review currency with passenger currency.
- Assuming you always need an instructor to regain passenger currency.
- Not tracking endorsement specifics and limitations in the logbook.
