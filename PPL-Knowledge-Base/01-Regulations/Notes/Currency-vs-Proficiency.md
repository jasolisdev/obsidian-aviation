# Currency vs Proficiency

## What it is
- `Currency`: legal minimums required to exercise privileges.
- `Proficiency`: actual skill level and decision quality in current conditions.

## Key legal currency references
- `61.56`: flight review every 24 calendar months.
- `61.57`: passenger and night passenger recent experience.

## Checkride angle
A strong answer explains that being legal does not always mean being ready. You should apply personal minimums and recency standards above the legal floor when needed.

## Common mistakes
- Equating current with proficient.
- Ignoring rust in crosswind, short-field, or night operations.
- Not maintaining a deliberate proficiency plan between lessons.

## References
- 14 CFR 61.56
- 14 CFR 61.57
