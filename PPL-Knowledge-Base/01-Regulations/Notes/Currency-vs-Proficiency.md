# Currency vs Proficiency

## What it is
Currency is the legal minimum (e.g., three takeoffs/landings in 90 days to carry passengers per FAR 61.57), while proficiency is your personal confidence and recent practice—there is no regulation for proficiency, but it is a safety imperative.

## Why it matters
Your DPE wants to hear that you meet the regulatory currency requirements and that you also fly to stay proficient; going beyond legal minimums shows maturity and reduces risk.

## How it shows up on a checkride
- **Q:** “How do you stay current to carry passengers?” **A:** Complete at least three takeoffs and landings in the same category/class within 90 days in the same type of operation (day vs. night).
- **Q:** “What do you do if 90 days pass?” **A:** Fly with a safety pilot, instructor, or perform a solo proficiency flight until you complete a new set of takeoffs and landings.
- **Q:** “What is the difference between currency and proficiency?” **A:** Currency is legal (FAR-based), proficiency is your own evaluation of skills—both are essential.

## Common mistakes
- Mistaking currency for proficiency and flying to minimums even when conditions are marginal.
- Forgetting to log the flights that satisfy currency so you can prove compliance if asked.
- Not refreshing skills (e.g., short-field landings) during long periods of perfect weather.
