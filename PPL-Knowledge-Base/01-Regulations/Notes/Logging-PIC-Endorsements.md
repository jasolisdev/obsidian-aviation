# Logging PIC & Endorsements

## What it is
`61.51` governs flight time logging. A major checkride topic is the difference between `logging PIC` and `acting as PIC`.

## Core PIC logging concepts
- A rated pilot may log PIC when sole manipulator of controls in an aircraft for which rated.
- A student pilot may log PIC when sole occupant and properly endorsed for the operation.
- Dual received and PIC can be logged simultaneously in certain legal scenarios.

## Endorsement tracking
Track required endorsements with date, aircraft, and scope. Not all endorsements expire; student solo endorsements have specific validity windows.

## Checkride angle
Expect scenario questions like:
- "Can this flight be logged as PIC, dual, or both?"
- "What endorsement was required before this operation?"

## Common mistakes
- Equating all logged PIC time with acting-PIC authority.
- Missing category/class rating condition for sole-manipulator PIC logging.
- Incomplete endorsement records.
