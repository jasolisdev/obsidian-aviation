# Logging PIC & Endorsements (PPL Focused)

## What it is
FAR 61.51 governs logging pilot-in-command time and required endorsements; FAR 61.87/61.31 describe the solo, cross-country, night, and high-performance endorsements you need as a private pilot.

## Why it matters
A DPE will expect you to discuss how you log PIC time, what qualifies as PIC, and the endorsements that show up on your logbook; failure to understand endorsement limits is a regulatory red flag.

## How it shows up on a checkride
- **Q:** “When do you log PIC time?” **A:** When you are the sole manipulator of the flight controls of an aircraft for which you are rated and you are acting as PIC.
- **Q:** “What endorsements must a student pilot have before solo?” **A:** Instructor endorsement for the specific make/model, area, and duration; the endorsement must be in the logbook per FAR 61.87.
- **Q:** “What endorsement allows you to fly a high-performance airplane?” **A:** An instructor must endorse you after ground and flight training covering the high-performance characteristics (FAR 61.31).

## Common mistakes
- Logging dual received time as PIC because you were manipulators of the controls while receiving instruction.
- Letting endorsements expire or not noting the specific limitations (aircraft, maneuvers, conditions).
- Forgetting that an endorsement for a complex airplane is separate from the high-performance endorsement.
