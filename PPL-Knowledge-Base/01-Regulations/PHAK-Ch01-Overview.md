# PHAK Chapter 1: Introduction to Flying

This chapter lays the foundation for your pilot training. While some of it is historical, the critical parts for your private pilot training focus on **how you get certified**, **who regulates you**, and the **definitions** that govern the aviation world.

## Key Concepts

- **Pilot Certification:** The ladder from Student to ATP.
- **Medical Certification:** ensuring you are physically fit to fly.
- **Aircraft Classification:** Understanding the difference between "Category" for airmen vs. aircraft.
- **The FAA & Regulations:** The role of the FSDO and the regulations (14 CFR).

## Study Notes

### 1. Pilot Certificates & Ratings
- [[01-Regulations/Notes/Pilot-Certificates-Hierarchy|Pilot Certificates Hierarchy]]: Student, Private, Commercial, ATP.
- [[01-Regulations/Notes/Part61-vs-Part141-Training|Part 61 vs. Part 141]]: Two paths to the same license.

### 2. Medical Factors (Regulatory)
- [[01-Regulations/Notes/Medical-Certificates-Duration|Medical Certificates & BasicMed]]: Classes, durations, and privileges.

### 3. Definitions
- [[01-Regulations/Notes/Aircraft-Category-Class-Type|Category, Class, & Type]]: The most confusing definition in aviation—master it early.

### 4. Regulatory Bodies
- [[01-Regulations/Notes/FAA-FSDO-DPE-Roles|FAA, FSDO, & DPEs]]: Who is checking your work?

## Checkride Focus
The DPE *will* ask about:
1. **Privileges and Limitations:** What can you actually do with your PPL?
2. **Currency vs. Expiration:** When does your paper license expire? (Never, mostly). When does your medical expire?
3. **Category/Class:** Can you fly a multi-engine plane? Why not?
