# PHAK Chapters 9 & 10: Performance & Weight/Balance

The math of flying. These chapters ensure you can get off the ground, clear the trees, and land safely—without falling out of the sky because you loaded the passengers wrong.

## Key Concepts
- **Weight & Balance:** Center of Gravity (CG), Arm, Moment, Datum.
- **Performance:** Density Altitude, Takeoff/Landing Distances, Climb Rates ($V_X$ vs $V_Y$).
- **Charts:** Crosswind Component, Cruise Performance.

## Study Notes
- [[07-Performance-WeightBalance/Notes/Weight-Balance-Workflow|Weight & Balance Workflow]]: How to calculate CG and why it matters.
- [[07-Performance-WeightBalance/Notes/Density-Altitude-Impact|Density Altitude]]: The invisible killer.
- [[07-Performance-WeightBalance/Notes/Performance-Charts-Checks|Performance Charts]]: Interpolation and reading the POH.
- [[07-Performance-WeightBalance/Notes/Center-of-Gravity-Shifts|CG Shifts & Stability]]: Forward vs. Aft CG effects.

## Checkride Focus
- **Aft CG:** Why is it dangerous? (Spin recovery is impossible, stability is reduced).
- **Forward CG:** Why is it dangerous? (Hard to flare, higher stall speed).
- **Density Altitude:** "It's 30°C at a 5,000ft elevation airport. Will we takeoff?"
