# Density Altitude (DA)

## Definition
**Pressure Altitude corrected for non-standard temperature.**
- It is "where the airplane *thinks* it is."
- **Formula:** $DA = Pressure Altitude + [120 \times (OAT - ISA Temp)]$.

## The Factors
High Density Altitude (Thin Air) is caused by:
1.  **High Elevation** (Less pressure).
2.  **High Temperature** (Molecules spread out).
3.  **High Humidity** (Water vapor is lighter than air). (Minor factor, but real).

## Effects on Performance
**High DA = Bad Performance.**
- **Takeoff Roll:** Longer (Engine makes less power, prop bites less air).
- **Climb Rate:** Reduced.
- **True Airspeed:** Higher (for same Indicated).
- **Landing Roll:** Longer (Higher ground speed on touchdown).

> [!WARNING] The Trap
> Your **Indicated Airspeed** for takeoff and landing **does not change**. You still rotate at 55 kts. But at high DA, 55 kts indicated might be 70 kts Ground Speed. You feel fast, but the wing feels slow.

## Checkride Angle
- **Scenario:** "It's 35°C at Denver (5,000 ft). We are at max gross weight. Will we clear the fence?"
- **Answer:** Check the charts. The DA might be 8,500 ft!

## Study Drills
1. Does high humidity increase or decrease density altitude? (Increases it—moist air is less dense).
2. What happens to takeoff distance at high DA? (Increases significantly).
