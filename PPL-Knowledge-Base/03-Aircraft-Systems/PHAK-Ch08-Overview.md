# PHAK Chapter 8: Flight Instruments

How do you know which way is up when you can't see the horizon? This chapter divides instruments into three families based on how they get their data.

## Key Concepts
- **Pitot-Static:** Airspeed, Altimeter, VSI. (Air pressure).
- **Gyroscopic:** Attitude, Heading, Turn Coordinator. (Spinning rigidity).
- **Magnetic:** Compass. (Earth's field).

## Study Notes
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Pitot-Static-System|Pitot-Static System]]: How blocked ports kill you.
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Gyroscopic-Instruments|Gyroscopic Instruments]]: Precession and Rigidity.
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Magnetic-Compass-Errors|Magnetic Compass Errors]]: ANDS and UNOS.

## Checkride Focus
- **Blocked Pitot:** "You fly into rain and your airspeed goes to zero. What happened?" (Blocked ram air hole).
- **Vacuum Failure:** "The suction gauge reads zero. Which instruments die?" (Attitude and Heading).
- **Compass Turns:** "You are turning North. Does the compass lead or lag?" (UNOS - Undershoot North).
