# Trim Tabs & Secondary Controls

## What it is
Secondary controls include trim systems and high-lift devices such as flaps. Trim reduces control forces; flaps trade speed for lift/drag characteristics.

## Why it matters
Poor trim management increases workload and can destabilize critical phases of flight.

## Checkride angle
- Use trim to relieve sustained control pressure, not to initiate maneuvering.
- Know differences between trim tab, servo tab, and anti-servo tab.
- Explain how flap extension changes pitch/drag and approach profile.

## Common mistakes
- Treating trim like an autopilot.
- Taking off with incorrect trim setting.
- Using flap settings without airspeed/POH discipline.
