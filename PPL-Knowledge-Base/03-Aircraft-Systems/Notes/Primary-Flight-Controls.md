# Primary Flight Controls

## What it is
Primary flight controls are ailerons, elevator/stabilator, and rudder. They govern roll, pitch, and yaw and are used together for coordinated control.

## Why it matters
The DPE will expect you to explain both axis effects and adverse effects (adverse yaw, overbanking tendency, pitch-power coupling).

## Checkride angle
- Ailerons: roll control, secondary yaw effect.
- Elevator/stabilator: pitch and AoA control.
- Rudder: yaw control and coordination.

## Common mistakes
- Turning with yoke only (uncoordinated flight).
- Overusing rudder at high speeds.
- Ignoring trim until control pressure builds excessively.
