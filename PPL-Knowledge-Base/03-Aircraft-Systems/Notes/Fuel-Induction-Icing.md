# Fuel, Induction, and Carb Ice

## What it is
Piston engines require continuous fuel delivery and induction airflow. Carburetor ice can form even in visible-moisture-free conditions and reduce engine power.

## Why it matters
Engine roughness and power loss questions are common oral topics. You need to explain cause, recognition, and immediate action.

## Checkride angle
- Carb ice risk is highest at partial power and favorable temp/humidity ranges.
- Carb heat initially may cause roughness and RPM drop before recovery.
- Fuel-injected engines avoid carb ice but still face induction icing and fuel-flow issues.

## Common mistakes
- Delaying carb heat after first signs of roughness.
- Misdiagnosing mixture mismanagement as carb ice.
- Forgetting fuel selector/mixture/fuel pump checks in engine troubleshooting.
