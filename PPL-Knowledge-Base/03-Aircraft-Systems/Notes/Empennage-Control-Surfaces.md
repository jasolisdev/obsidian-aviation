# Empennage & Primary Controls (Systems View)

## What it is
The empennage includes the vertical and horizontal stabilizing assemblies and their movable control surfaces. It provides directional and longitudinal stability and control authority.

## Why it matters
This ties structure knowledge (Chapter 3) to flight-control behavior (Chapter 6), which is exactly how examiners ask about it.
