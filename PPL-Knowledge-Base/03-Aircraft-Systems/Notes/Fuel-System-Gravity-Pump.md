# Fuel Systems: Gravity Feed vs Pump Feed

## What it is
Trainer aircraft generally use gravity-feed or pump-feed fuel systems. Understanding tank venting, selector logic, and pump redundancy is essential for safe operation.

## Why it matters
Fuel starvation and mismanagement are preventable accident causes. DPEs often test fuel system knowledge with scenario questions.

## Checkride angle
- Gravity-feed: relies on tank height above engine and proper venting.
- Pump-feed: uses engine-driven and/or electric pumps to maintain pressure.
- Know your aircraft-specific unusable fuel, tank switching, and emergency fuel procedures.

## Common mistakes
- Improper tank switching intervals.
- Misreading fuel gauges without time/burn cross-check.
- Forgetting vent blockage as a possible fuel-flow problem.
