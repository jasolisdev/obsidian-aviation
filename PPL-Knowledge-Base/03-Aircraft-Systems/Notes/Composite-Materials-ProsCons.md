# Composite Materials: Pros and Cons

## What it is
Composite aircraft structures use fiberglass, carbon fiber, or similar materials instead of traditional all-metal structures.

## Why it matters
You need to understand how damage signatures, inspection concerns, and repair practices differ from aluminum airframes.

## Pros
- Corrosion resistance.
- Potential weight and aerodynamic efficiency benefits.
- Smooth moldable surfaces.

## Cons
- Impact damage may be less visible externally.
- Repair methods are material/process sensitive.
- Heat/UV/environmental exposure can affect durability if not maintained.

## Checkride angle
Explain why preflight inspection must account for subtle cracks, delamination cues, and manufacturer-specific limitations.
