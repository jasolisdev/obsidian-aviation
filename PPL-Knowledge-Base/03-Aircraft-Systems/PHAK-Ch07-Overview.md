# PHAK Chapter 7: Aircraft Systems

This is the "Describe your Airplane" chapter. You must know your specific POH, but these notes cover the *principles* common to most trainers (C172/PA28).

## Key Concepts
- **Engine:** Reciprocating, 4-stroke cycle.
- **Induction:** Carburetor vs. Fuel Injection.
- **Ignition:** Magnetos (completely separate from the electrical system).
- **Fuel:** Gravity vs. Pump, Venting, Sumping.
- **Electrical:** Battery, Alternator, Buses.

## Study Notes
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Reciprocating-Powerplant-Basics|The 4-Stroke Engine]]: Intake, Compression, Power, Exhaust.
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Ignition-Magnetos|Ignition & Magnetos]]: Why we have two.
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Fuel-Induction-Icing|Induction & Carb Ice]]: Preventing engine failure.
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Electrical-System-Basics|Electrical System]]: Alternators and Batteries.
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Fuel-System-Gravity-Pump|Fuel Systems]]: Vents and Pumps.

## Checkride Focus
- **System Failure:** "If the master switch dies, does the engine quit?" (NO! Magnetos are self-powered).
- **Troubleshooting:** "High oil temperature and low oil pressure. What does it mean?" (Loss of oil -> impending seizure).
