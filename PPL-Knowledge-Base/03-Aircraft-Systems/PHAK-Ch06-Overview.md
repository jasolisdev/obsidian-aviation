# PHAK Chapter 6: Flight Controls

How the pilot exerts will over the machine. This chapter covers the mechanics of *how* the stick/yoke moves the surfaces and what secondary devices help you fly.

## Key Concepts
- **Primary Controls:** Ailerons (Roll), Elevator (Pitch), Rudder (Yaw).
- **Secondary Controls:** Flaps (Lift/Drag), Trim (Workload reduction).
- **Aerodynamic Balancing:** Tabs and balances that make the controls feel right.

## Study Notes
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Primary-Flight-Controls|Primary Flight Controls]]: The big three and how they work.
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Flaps-Types-Usage|Flaps Types & Usage]]: Plain, Split, Slotted, Fowler.
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Trim-Tabs-Secondary-Controls|Trim & Secondary Controls]]: Why we trim and how it works (Anti-Servo vs Servo).

## Checkride Focus
- **Adverse Yaw:** Why the ailerons create drag on the "up" wing.
- **Flap Failure:** What happens if one flap comes down and the other doesn't? (Asymmetric flap = Roll).
- **Trim Stalls:** Dangers of taking off with trim set incorrectly.
