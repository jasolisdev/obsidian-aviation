# PHAK Chapter 3: Aircraft Structure

This chapter covers the physical construction of the airplane. While PPLs don't need to be engineers, you need to know how your plane is built to understand preflight inspections and structural limitations.

## Key Concepts
- **Fuselage Construction:** Truss vs. Monocoque/Semi-Monocoque.
- **Wing Structure:** Spars, ribs, and skin.
- **Empennage:** The tail section (Vertical/Horizontal stabilizers).
- **Materials:** Aluminum vs. Composite.

## Study Notes
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Aircraft-Structure-Types|Structure Types & Fuselage]]: Truss, Monocoque, and Semi-Monocoque explained.
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Empennage-Control-Surfaces|Empennage & Primary Controls]]: Stabilizers, rudders, and elevators.
- [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Notes/Composite-Materials-ProsCons|Composite Materials]]: The shift to plastic planes (Cirrus/Diamond) and what to watch for.

## Checkride Focus
- **Preflight:** Why do we check rivets? (Stress signs).
- **Damage:** How does damage to a composite wing look different from aluminum? (Composites often hide internal damage).
- **V-Speeds:** Understanding how structural design limits $V_{NO}$ and $V_{NE}$.
