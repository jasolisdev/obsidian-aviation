# PHAK Chapter 5: Aerodynamics of Flight

This chapter takes the principles from Ch 4 and applies them to *maneuvering* flight. This is the "Safety Chapter"—understanding stalls, spins, and turns keeps you alive.

## Key Concepts
- **Turning Flight:** Horizontal/Vertical component of lift, Load Factor.
- **Stalls & Spins:** The Critical Angle of Attack.
- **Left Turning Tendencies:** Why you need right rudder.
- **Ground Effect:** The cushion near the runway.

## Study Notes
- [[02-Aerodynamics/Notes/Stalls-Spins-Critical-AoA|Stalls, Spins, & Critical AoA]]: The #1 concept for safety.
- [[02-Aerodynamics/Notes/Left-Turning-Tendencies|Left Turning Tendencies]]: Torque, P-Factor, Spiraling Slipstream, Gyroscopic Precession.
- [[02-Aerodynamics/Notes/Load-Factor-Maneuvering|Load Factor & Turns]]: Why planes stall at higher speeds when banking.
- [[02-Aerodynamics/Notes/Ground-Effect-Wake-Turbulence|Ground Effect]]: Floating on landing.

## Checkride Focus
- **Stall Recovery:** "Reduce Angle of Attack" is always the answer.
- **Spin Recovery:** PARE acronym.
- **Load Factor:** Why a 60-degree bank makes you feel heavy (2Gs) and raises stall speed.
