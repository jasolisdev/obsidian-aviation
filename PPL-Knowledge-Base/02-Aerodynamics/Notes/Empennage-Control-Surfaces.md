# Empennage & Control Surfaces

## What it is
The empennage is the tail assembly that provides pitch and yaw stability/control through the horizontal and vertical stabilizing surfaces.

## Why it matters
You must explain tail function during normal flight and stalls, and recognize how trim and tail design affect controllability.

## Components
- Horizontal stabilizer + elevator (or stabilator): pitch stability and control.
- Vertical stabilizer + rudder: directional stability and yaw control.
- Trim tab/anti-servo tab (if installed): control force management.

## Checkride angle
Aft CG generally reduces longitudinal stability and can increase risk during stall recovery. Tail authority and trim position are part of the explanation.

## Common mistakes
- Calling the elevator a primary source of lift.
- Forgetting rudder's role in coordinated stalls/slow flight.
- Not checking trim position before takeoff.
