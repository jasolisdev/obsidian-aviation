# Stalls, Spins, & Stability

## What it is
Stalls occur when the wing exceeds its critical angle of attack; spins happen when one wing stalls more than the other. Stability (longitudinal, lateral, directional) describes how the airplane returns to straight flight or diverges when disturbed.

## Why it matters
You need to explain stall/spin recognition, recovery, and how load factor or configuration changes affect the stall buffet. DPEs grade how confidently you describe those defense-in-depth procedures.

## How it shows up on a checkride
- **Q:** “Describe the stall warning you feel and what you do.” **A:** Buffeting/slow controls → reduce AoA, add full power, stabilize attitude before returning to cruise.
- **Q:** “Why is spiral instability dangerous?” **A:** The airplane will tighten the turn and dive if left unchecked; recover with opposite rudder and neutral ailerons.
- **Q:** “What is the first step in a spin recovery?” **A:** PARE (Power idle, Ailerons neutral, Rudder opposite spin, Elevator briskly forward).

## Common mistakes
- Jumping to full power before reducing AoA; that deepens the stall and may develop a spin.
- Using ailerons to try to keep inside a spin; this increases the angle of attack on the more stalled wing.
- Assuming an airplane is inherently stable; even stable airplanes require pitch/power coordination after disturbances.
