# Airfoil Terminology

## Definitions
You must speak the language of the wing to understand stalls.

- **Leading Edge:** The front edge of the wing.
- **Trailing Edge:** The back edge.
- **Chord Line:** An imaginary straight line connecting the leading and trailing edges.
- **Camber:** The curvature of the wing (upper and lower).
- **Relative Wind:** The direction of airflow with respect to the wing. *It is always parallel to and opposite the flight path.*
- **Angle of Attack (AoA):** The angle between the **Chord Line** and the **Relative Wind**.

## Why It Matters
**Lift is generated by AoA.** The pilot controls AoA directly with the elevator. If you exceed the **Critical AoA**, the wing stalls.

## Checkride Angle
- **Question:** "Does the Angle of Attack change if I fly faster?"
- **Answer:** Yes. To maintain level flight at higher speed, you must reduce the AoA (pitch down slightly) to keep lift constant (Lift = Weight).

## Study Drills
1. What defines the Angle of Attack? (Chord Line vs. Relative Wind).
2. Can you change the chord line? (No, it's fixed to the wing structure, unless you use flaps which effectively change it).
