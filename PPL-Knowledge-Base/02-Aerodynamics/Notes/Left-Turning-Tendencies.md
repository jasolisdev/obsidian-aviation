# Left Turning Tendencies

## Definition
The four forces that cause a single-engine propeller airplane to turn left, especially during high power and low airspeed (Takeoff/Climb).

## The Big Four

### 1. Torque
- **Cause:** Newton's 3rd Law. The prop spins clockwise (from pilot view), so the plane tries to roll counter-clockwise (left).
- **Effect:** Rolls the plane left.

### 2. P-Factor (Asymmetric Loading)
- **Cause:** At high AoA, the descending blade (right side) takes a bigger "bite" of air than the ascending blade (left side) because it has a higher relative AoA.
- **Effect:** Yaws the plane left.
- **Most Noticeable:** High power, High AoA (Climb).

### 3. Spiraling Slipstream
- **Cause:** Prop wash spirals around the fuselage and hits the *left* side of the vertical fin.
- **Effect:** Yaws the tail right, nose goes left.

### 4. Gyroscopic Precession
- **Cause:** A force applied to a spinning gyro is felt 90° later in rotation.
- **Effect:** Mainly taildraggers on takeoff (lifting the tail).

## Checkride Angle
- **Question:** "Why do you need right rudder on takeoff?"
- **Answer:** To counteract Torque, P-Factor, and Spiraling Slipstream.

## Study Drills
1. Which tendency is strongest at high angles of attack? (P-Factor).
2. Which tendency acts like a "corkscrew" of air? (Spiraling Slipstream).
