# PHAK Chapter 4: Principles of Flight

The physics of *why* an airplane flies. This chapter deals with the atmosphere, theories of lift, and the fundamental forces.

## Key Concepts
- **Atmosphere:** Pressure, density, and standard atmosphere.
- **Theories of Lift:** Bernoulli vs. Newton.
- **Airfoil Geometry:** Chord, camber, AoA.
- **The Four Forces:** Lift, Weight, Thrust, Drag.
- **Stability:** Static vs. Dynamic.

## Study Notes
- [[02-Aerodynamics/Notes/Four-Forces-Principles|The Four Forces]]: How they balance (or don't).
- [[02-Aerodynamics/Notes/Airfoil-Terminology|Airfoil Terminology]]: The language of wings (Chord line vs. Relative Wind).
- [[02-Aerodynamics/Notes/Stability-Control-Axes|Stability & Axes]]: Pitch/Roll/Yaw and why the plane returns to level.

## Checkride Focus
- **Bernoulli vs. Newton:** You don't need to be a physicist, but know that *both* apply (pressure differential + downwash).
- **Angle of Attack:** This is the single most important definition to memorize.
