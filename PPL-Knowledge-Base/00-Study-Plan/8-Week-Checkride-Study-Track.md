## Week 8
- Focus: Full checkride integration.
- Execute:

3. Add one scenario question to [[08-Oral-Exam/Oral-QA|Oral Q&A]].

## Readiness gates
- [ ] Required regulation notes are `checkride-ready`.
- [ ] W&B/performance can be solved from a real POH without help.
- [ ] 50 random oral questions answered at >85% accuracy.
- [ ] Weather go/no-go decisions are defendable with sources.
