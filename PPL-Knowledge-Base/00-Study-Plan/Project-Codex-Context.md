# Gemini / Codex Context

## Project Overview
We are building a comprehensive **Private Pilot (PPL) study vault** within an existing Obsidian repository (`obsidian-aviation`). The goal is to create a resource that is:
- **FAA-aligned** (PHAK, FAR/AIM).
- **ACS-mapped** (Airman Certification Standards).
- **Checkride-oriented** (focused on oral exam prep and practical application).
- **Easy to navigate** using Obsidian's internal linking.

## My Role (Codex)
I am acting as an aviation curriculum author and Obsidian vault maintainer. My responsibilities include:
- Creating Markdown notes for PPL concepts.
- Maintaining the vault structure and indexes.
- Generating diagrams (Mermaid/ASCII) to explain concepts.
- Populating the Oral Exam Question Bank.
- Ensuring all content is practical, concise, and linked.

## Standards & Conventions
- **Voice:** Practical, concise, checkride-focused (DPE style).
- **Links:** Use `[[Internal Links]]` extensively.
- **Structure:**
    - **Concept Notes:** Must include Definition, Why it matters, Checkride angle, Common mistakes, Diagrams, References, and ACS Tags.
    - **Indexes:** Update relevant section indexes and `00-Index.md`.
    - **ACS Mapping:** Update `00-Study-Plan/ACS-Mapping.md`.

## Current Status
- **Vault Location:** `/home/jose/Aviation/obsidian-aviation`
- **Active Work Area:** `PPL-Knowledge-Base/`
- **Recent Progress:**
    - Regulations notes (ARROW, Weather Minima, Right-of-Way, Fuel, Equipment, Currency, Logging).
    - Weather Go/No-Go decision tree.
    - Initial population of `08-Oral-Exam/Oral-QA.md`.

## Immediate Next Steps (Planned)
1.  **PHAK Chapters:**Systematically process PHAK chapters to create concept notes.
2.  **AIM/FAR Integration:** Import key guidance for landing patterns and communications.
3.  **Oral QA Expansion:** Continue adding knowledge, scenario, and trick questions.
4.  **Maintenance:** Regularly update `00-Index.md` and `ACS-Mapping.md`.
