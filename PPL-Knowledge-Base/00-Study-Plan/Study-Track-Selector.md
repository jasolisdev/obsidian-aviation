# Study Track Selector

Choose the track that matches schedule, training tempo, and support environment.

## Track comparison

| Track | Typical timeline | Weekly study load | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [[00-Study-Plan/Track-Self-Paced|Self-Paced Track]] | 14-20 weeks | 3-4 sessions/week | Learners with variable schedules |
| [[00-Study-Plan/8-Week-Checkride-Study-Track|Balanced 8-Week Track]] | 8 weeks | 5 sessions/week | Most independent learners |
| [[00-Study-Plan/Track-Accelerated|Accelerated Track]] | 5-7 weeks | 6 sessions/week | Immersive full-time prep |
| [[00-Study-Plan/Track-Flight-School-Cohort|Flight-School Cohort Track]] | 10-14 weeks | School cadence + stage checks | Programs with structured syllabi |

## How to pick quickly

1. If schedule is inconsistent: use [[00-Study-Plan/Track-Self-Paced|Self-Paced Track]].
2. If you can sustain near-daily prep: use [[00-Study-Plan/8-Week-Checkride-Study-Track|Balanced 8-Week Track]].
3. If checkride date is very soon and training is full-time: use [[00-Study-Plan/Track-Accelerated|Accelerated Track]].
4. If enrolled in a formal academy/school block program: use [[00-Study-Plan/Track-Flight-School-Cohort|Flight-School Cohort Track]].

## Common rules (all tracks)

- Use [[00-Study-Plan/FAA-Current-References-2026|FAA Current References (2026 Baseline)]] before checkride week.
- Track weak areas in [[08-Oral-Exam/Trick-Questions|Trick Questions]].
- Drill questions from [[08-Oral-Exam/Oral-QA|Oral Q&A]] every study week.
- Keep ACS coverage visible in [[00-Study-Plan/ACS-Mapping|ACS Mapping]].
