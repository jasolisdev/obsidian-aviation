# ACS Mapping

Goal: every concept note includes at least one ACS reference in frontmatter.

## How to tag notes

In a note's frontmatter, use:

- `acs:` e.g., `PA.I.A` (placeholder format)
- `sources:` e.g., `["PHAK Ch 4", "FAR 91.205"]`
- `status:` `seed | refining | checkride-ready`

## Quick checklist for a "checkride-ready" note

- Plain-English definition
- 1 diagram (Mermaid/ASCII) that you can redraw verbally
- Common misconception + correction
- 3–5 oral questions with short answers
- References to source paragraphs/pages
