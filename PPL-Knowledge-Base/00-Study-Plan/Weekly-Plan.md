## Cadence

- New concept notes: 3–5/week
- Oral drill: 10–20 minutes, 3x/week
- Weekly review: update `Progress` + tighten weak notes

## Workflow

- Use [[00-Study-Plan/PHRK-Roadmap|PHRK Roadmap]] to pick the next chapter, then follow the “PHAK chapter → concept notes” prompt in [[Notes/Codex-Prompt|Codex Prompt]].
- Add new notes to the relevant [[01-Regulations/Concepts|Regulations]], [[02-Aerodynamics/Concepts|Aerodynamics]], [[03-Aircraft-Systems/Concepts|Aircraft Systems]], etc., indexes and tag them with ACS entries before each oral drill.
