# Accelerated Track

A high-intensity track for short timelines and full-time focus.

## Suggested duration
- 5-7 weeks total.
- 6 study days per week.
- Frequent oral and scenario drills.

## Weekly operating model
- Day 1-3: heavy content intake + note consolidation.
- Day 4-5: scenario integration + oral defense reps.
- Day 6: full mixed-domain mock session.
- Day 7: rest and recovery.

## Module cadence

### Week 1
- Regulations, documents, currency, and medical pathways.

### Week 2
- Aerodynamics + Aircraft systems.

### Week 3
- Weather theory/products + decision logic.

### Week 4
- Navigation, airspace, and communications.

### Week 5
- Performance, W&B, and checkride-style scenario synthesis.

### Week 6+
- Full oral mocks, spot remediations, and currency checks against FAA references.

## Risk controls
- Do not skip recovery days.
- Use a missed-question log every day.
- Re-check all date-sensitive rules in the FAA references note.

## Completion standard
- 2 consecutive mock orals with strong pass-level answers.
- No unresolved high-risk legal inaccuracies in weak-area log.
