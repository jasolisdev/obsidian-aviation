# Progress

Mark concepts as you make notes and feel confident explaining them out loud.

## Regulations

- [ ] Privileges/limitations (Part 61)
- [ ] VFR weather minimums (Part 91)
- [ ] Required inspections/maintenance basics
- [ ] Right-of-way rules

## Aerodynamics

- [ ] Lift/drag/thrust (big picture)
- [ ] Angle of attack vs stall
- [ ] Spins (why they happen, how to avoid)
- [ ] Stability (static/dynamic) and control

## Aircraft Systems

- [ ] Pitot-static + common failures
- [ ] Electrical system basics
- [ ] Fuel/engine basics (your aircraft specifics later)

## Weather

- [ ] Atmosphere + stability
- [ ] Cloud types + weather implications
- [ ] METAR/TAF decoding
- [ ] Weather hazards (icing, convection, turbulence)

## Navigation

## Human Factors

- [ ] IMSAFE + personal minimums
- [ ] Hypoxia/hyperventilation
- [ ] ADM (PAVE/5P)

## Performance & W/B

- [ ] Density altitude (why it matters)
- [ ] Weight & balance (how to compute, what changes)

## Oral Exam
