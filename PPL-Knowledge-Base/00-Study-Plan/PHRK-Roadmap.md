# PHAK Roadmap & Chapter Breakdown

This is the guided structure for turning the FAA's *Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge* into your living knowledge base. Use Obsidian's Templates and the Codex prompts (see [[Codex Prompts]]) to build one concept note per idea, include a diagram, ACS tag, and oral questions.

## Study Structure

1. **Foundation (Weeks 1-4)** – Chapters 1‑7: mindset, decision-making, flight physics, systems, and instrumentation. Build 3–5 notes per chapter, anchor with diagrams, and log quick wins in `Progress`.
2. **Application (Weeks 5-8)** – Chapters 8‑13: instruments, POH docs, weight/balance, weather theory, and services. Link each chapter to a relevant ACS area and add real reports (METAR/TAF) to the note.
3. **Refinement (Weeks 9-12)** – Chapters 14‑17: airports/airspace, navigation, and aeromedical factors plus appendices. Begin oral exam drills with `Templates/Oral Drill.md`.

## Weekly Cadence Template

- **Monday:** Chunk a chapter section (about 6–8 pages) and use the Codex prompt to turn it into 3 concept notes.
- **Tuesday:** Refine diagrams and add ACS references + sources.
- **Wednesday:** Run an oral drill using the new notes; log missed questions in `08-Oral-Exam/Trick-Questions`.
- **Thursday:** Repeat with the next section of the chapter.
- **Friday:** Review, connect to other chapters via backlinks, and update `Progress`.
- **Weekend:** Watch a curated video or decode real METAR/TAF; store the summary in Weather or Oral Exam folders as needed.

## Chapter Breakdown (PHAK H-8083-25C)

| Chapter | Focus | How to break it down | Outputs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Introduction to Flying | FAA history, certificates, ACS, AIM, NOTAM basics | Extract eligibility, exam process, and regulatory overview (one note per main topic) | Concept notes for certificates, regs, FAA org, checkride readiness |
| 2. Aeronautical Decision-Making | PAVE, 5Ps, DECIDE, SRM, automation risks | Force decision tree diagrams + risk assessment examples | ACS-aligned notes on risk mgmt; oral Q&A on hazardous attitudes |
| 3. Aircraft Construction | Structure, materials, composite considerations, instrumentation shift | Note on each major component (fuselage, wings, empennage, landing gear, powerplant) | Diagram of load paths and maintenance callouts |
| 4. Principles of Flight | Atmosphere, lift theories, pressure/density altitude | Create Mermaid flow for lift generation + density altitude example | Clarify misconceptions (e.g., “higher airspeed always means more lift”) |
| 5. Aerodynamics of Flight | Forces, drag, stability, stalls, high-speed flight | Split: forces/torque; stability axes; stalls; load factors; V<sub>g</sub> diagrams | V​g chart note, stall/spin avoidance diagram, load factor vs maneuver table |
| 6. Flight Controls | Primary/secondary controls, tabs, automation | Note per control surface + autopilot interaction (include POH-specific linkage later) | Control input diagrams; common failure modes |
| 7. Aircraft Systems | Powerplant, prop, induction, electrical, fuel, oxygen, anti-ice | Group by subsystem: engine, fuel, electrical, anti-ice/pressurization | ACS notes for systems-related oral questions; include POH references |
| 8. Flight Instruments | Pitot-static, gyros, ADC, compass, AoA | Provide failure scenarios and mitigation (diagram pitot-static blockage) | Checklist for instrument scan; misconceptions about instrument indications |
| 9. Flight Manuals & Docs | POH sections, ADs, inspections, MEL | Restore POH pages to `PDFs/` and map to note segments: limitations, emergency, performance | Include inspective question set for oral exam and cross-reference FAR 91 |
| 10. Weight & Balance | CG, computation methods, shifting weight | Worked examples with your aircraft (use POH) | Note each computation method + quick-check cheat sheet |
| 11. Aircraft Performance | Takeoff/landing, charts, density altitude | Build diagram of runway performance factors; annotate charts | Include DPE-style questions from performance tables |
| 12. Weather Theory | Atmosphere, fronts, stability, hazards | Diagram convection, front characteristics, icing; link to chapter 13 products | Provide oral Qs on how a warm front affects cloud ceiling |
| 13. Aviation Weather Services | METAR/TAF/MTR, briefings, charts | Decode an actual METAR/TAF per note; map each product to decision making | Add question-per-product (e.g., “When does an AIRMET become SIGMET?”) |
| 14. Airport Ops | Signs, lighting, radio procedures, runway safety | Note per signage group + LAHSO/runway incursion prevention; include checklist | Diagram airport lighting and ATC phraseology for lost comm |
| 15. Airspace | Class ABCDEFG, special-use, TFRs, unmanned | Create table of airspace requirements, limitations, entry procedures | Add oral Q categories (weather minimums, equipment) per airspace |
| 16. Navigation | Charts, pilotage, VOR, GPS, lost procedures | Map chart symbols, VFR nav steps, GPS RAIM check | Note for each nav aid + lost comm decision flow |
| 17. Aeromedical Factors | Hypoxia, spatial disorientation, drugs, vision | Diagram hypoxia types + stress/fatigue checklist | Link to IMSAFE note in Human Factors folder |

## Next Actions

1. Start with Chapter 1: run the Codex “PHAK chapter → concept notes” prompt a section at a time; 3–5 notes per chapter.  
2. Add your POH to `PDFs/` and use the Chapter 9 note flow to connect procedures/limitations to *your* airplane.  
3. Weekly, run an oral drill (Template `Oral Drill.md`) pulling questions from the new chapter notes and log misses in `Trick Questions`.  

Need stubs for any chapter right now? Name the chapter/section and I’ll scaffold the first few concept notes.
