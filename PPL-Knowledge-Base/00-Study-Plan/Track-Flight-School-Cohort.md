# Flight-School Cohort Track

A cohort-friendly track aligned to school syllabi, stage checks, and group sessions.

## Suggested duration
- 10-14 weeks total.
- Syncs with typical Part 141/structured Part 61 stage flow.

## Recommended cadence
- 2-3 instructor-led ground sessions/week.
- 2 flight lessons/week.
- 1 cohort oral drill/week.
- 1 individual remediation block/week.

## Stage model

### Stage 1
- Certification framework, aircraft docs, weather minima, ADM basics.

### Stage 2
- Aerodynamics, maneuvers, flight controls, systems reliability.

### Stage 3
- Cross-country planning, weather services, airspace, nav aids.

### Stage 4
- Performance/W&B mastery, emergency scenarios, mock oral/practical prep.

## Cohort operations
- Keep a shared missed-question pool.
- Assign rotating scenario leader each week.
- Require source-backed answers (FAA refs) for disputed items.

## Completion standard
- Stage-check readiness verified by instructor.
- Cohort mock oral pass threshold met.
- Individual weak-area list resolved before checkride scheduling.
