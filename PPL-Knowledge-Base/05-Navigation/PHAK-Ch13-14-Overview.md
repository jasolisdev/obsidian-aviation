# PHAK Chapters 13 & 14: Airports & Airspace

Where we fly and the rules of the road. Chapter 13 covers the ground (Signs, Markings, Lighting), and Chapter 14 covers the sky (Airspace classes).

## Key Concepts
- **Runways:** Markings, Displaced Thresholds, Lighting (VASI/PAPI).
- **Taxiways:** Hold Short Lines (The most important line in aviation), Signs.
- **Airspace:** A, B, C, D, E, G, and Special Use.

## Study Notes
- [[05-Navigation/Notes/Airport-Signage-Markings|Airport Signs & Markings]]: Red means STOP. Black means YOU ARE HERE.
- [[05-Navigation/Notes/Airspace-Classes-Triangle|Airspace Classes]]: The upside-down wedding cake and friends. (Review Regs notes too).
- [[05-Navigation/Notes/Runway-Lighting-Visual-Aids|Runway Lighting]]: PAPI, VASI, and Beacons.

## Checkride Focus
- **Hold Short:** "What does a double solid/double dashed yellow line mean?" (Hold short on the solid side).
- **Runway Incursion Avoidance:** "When can you cross a hold short line?" (Only with clearance or if at an untowered field and clear).
- **Airspace:** "What equipment do I need for Class C?" (Mode C Transponder + 2-way Radio).
