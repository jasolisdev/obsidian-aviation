## Glide Path Indicators

### VASI (Visual Approach Slope Indicator)
- 2 Bars (Near and Far).
- **Red over White:** You're alright (On glide path).
- **White over White:** You're high as a kite.
- **Red over Red:** You're dead (Too low).

### PAPI (Precision Approach Path Indicator)
- 4 Lights in a single row.
- **4 White:** Too High.
- **3 White / 1 Red:** Slightly High.
- **2 White / 2 Red:** On Glide Path (3°).
- **4 Red:** Too Low.

- **Civil Land:** White and Green.
- **Military:** White, White, Green. (Dual white flash).
- **Water:** White and Yellow.

## Runway Lights
- **End Identifier Lights (REIL):** Flashing white strobes at corners of approach end.
- **Edge Lights (HIRL/MIRL/LIRL):** White (turn Amber on last 2,000 ft).
- **Centerline Lights:** White (turn alternating Red/White last 3,000 ft, all Red last 1,000 ft).

## Checkride Angle
- **Question:** "You see a beacon flashing white and green during the day. What does it mean?"
- **Answer:** The airport is IFR (Visibility < 3 SM or Ceiling < 1,000 ft).
