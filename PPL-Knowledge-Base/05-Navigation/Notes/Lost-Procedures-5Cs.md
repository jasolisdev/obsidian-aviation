# Lost Procedures (The 5 Cs)

## Definition
The standard operating procedure for re-orienting yourself when you are unsure of your position.

## The 5 Cs
1.  **Climb:** High altitude = Better radio range, better VOR reception, better visibility.
2.  **Circle:** Don't keep flying away from your last known point. Circle to stay put while you think.
3.  **Confess:** Admit to yourself (and passengers) that you are lost. Don't let pride kill you.
4.  **Communicate:** Call ATC (121.5 or Center/Approach). "Cessna 123AB, Student Pilot, unsure of position."
5.  **Comply:** Follow ATC instructions (Squawk ident, vector headings).

## Alternative: Conservation
Some teach "Conserve Fuel" (Lean the mixture, reduce power) as a 6th C.

## Checkride Angle
- **Scenario:** "You looked at your map for 10 minutes and nothing matches. What do you do?"
- **Answer:** **CLIMB** immediately. Then start the 5 Cs.
- **Tip:** DPEs love to simulate this by taking your iPad away.

## Study Drills
1. Why is "Climb" the first C? (It solves radio, reception, and visibility problems instantly).
2. What frequency is the universal emergency channel? (121.5 MHz).
