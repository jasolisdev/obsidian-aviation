# PHAK Chapter 2: Aeronautical Decision-Making (ADM)

ADM is a systematic approach to the mental process used by pilots to consistently determine the best course of action in response to a given set of circumstances. It is arguably the most important skill you learn, as most accidents are caused by human error, not mechanical failure.

## Key Concepts

- **Hazard vs. Risk:** A hazard is a real event (weather, mechanic failure); risk is the future impact of that hazard.
- **The Human Element:** Why smart people make bad choices (attitudes, stress, fatigue).
- **Decision Models:** Structured ways to think under pressure (DECIDE, PAVE, 5Ps).
- **SRM:** Single-Pilot Resource Management (using all available resources).

## Study Notes

### 1. The Enemy Within
- [[06-Human-Factors/Notes/Hazardous-Attitudes-Antidotes|The 5 Hazardous Attitudes]]: You *must* memorize these and their antidotes.
- [[06-Human-Factors/Notes/Stress-Fatigue-Management|Stress & Fatigue]]: Acute vs. Chronic, and why "pushing through" kills pilots.

### 2. Risk Management Tools
- [[06-Human-Factors/Notes/PAVE-Checklist|The PAVE Checklist]]: Preflight risk assessment (Pilot, Aircraft, EnVironment, External Pressures).
- [[06-Human-Factors/Notes/IMSAFE-Decision-Loop|IMSAFE Checklist]]: Evaluating the Pilot (already exists, review it).

### 3. In-Flight Decision Making
- [[06-Human-Factors/Notes/DECIDE-Model|The DECIDE Model]]: A loop for handling in-flight changes.
- [[06-Human-Factors/Notes/SRM-5Ps-Automation|SRM & The 5 Ps]]: Plan, Plane, Pilot, Passengers, Programming.

## Checkride Focus
The DPE will not just ask "What is ADM?" They will give you a **scenario**:
*   "You are flying to a wedding. Weather is getting worse. Your passengers are complaining. What do you do?"
*   They are looking for you to **apply** PAVE or DECIDE and **verbalize** your resistance to hazardous attitudes (like "Get-there-itis").
