# Hypoxia Types & Symptoms

## Definition
A state of oxygen deficiency in the body sufficient to impair function.

## The 4 Types (Memorize This)

1.  **Hypoxic:** Not enough O2 in the air. (e.g., Altitude).
    - *The "thin air" hypoxia.*
2.  **Hypemic:** Blood cannot carry the O2. (e.g., Carbon Monoxide poisoning, Anemia).
    - *The "transport" hypoxia.*
3.  **Stagnant:** Blood isn't moving. (e.g., High Gs, Cold temps constricting vessels).
    - *The "flow" hypoxia.*
4.  **Histotoxic:** Cells can't use the O2. (e.g., Alcohol, Drugs).
    - *The "poison" hypoxia.*

## Symptoms
- Euphoria (feeling great/drunk).
- Cyanosis (Blue lips/fingernails).
- Headache.
- Impaired judgment.
- **DANGER:** You often feel *good* while dying.

## Hyperventilation (The Opposite)
- **Cause:** Stress/Panic leads to rapid breathing -> Flushes CO2 from blood.
- **Symptoms:** Lightheadedness, tingling in fingers, fainting.
- **Distinction:** Symptoms overlap with Hypoxia.
- **Treatment:** Talk aloud (forces slow breathing), breathe into bag. **Descend.** (Treats both).

## Checkride Angle
- **Scenario:** "You feel a headache and the heater is on. What is it?"
- **Answer:** Carbon Monoxide poisoning (Hypemic Hypoxia). Turn off heat, open vents, land ASAP.

## Study Drills
1. Which hypoxia is caused by alcohol? (Histotoxic).
2. Which hypoxia is caused by a blocked exhaust manifold? (Hypemic - CO).
