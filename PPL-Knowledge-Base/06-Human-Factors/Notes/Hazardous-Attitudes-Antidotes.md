# Hazardous Attitudes & Antidotes

## Definition
Five specific mental states that interfere with the ability to make sound decisions. The FAA has identified these as the root cause of many accidents.

## Why It Matters
Recognizing these in yourself is the first step to stopping a bad chain of events. You cannot "cure" them, but you can counteract them with a specific **Antidote**.

## The 5 Attitudes

| Attitude | Definition | **The Antidote** (Memorize This) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anti-Authority** | "Don't tell me what to do." Resentment of rules/control. | **"Follow the rules. They are usually right."** |
| **Impulsivity** | "Do it quickly." Feeling the need to do *something* immediately. | **"Not so fast. Think first."** |
| **Invulnerability** | "It won't happen to me." Believing accidents only happen to others. | **"It could happen to me."** |
| **Macho** | "I can do it." Trying to prove yourself or show off. | **"Taking chances is foolish."** |
| **Resignation** | "What's the use?" Feeling helpless, leaving it to fate/ATC. | **"I am not helpless. I can make a difference."** |

## Checkride Angle
- The DPE will likely give you a scenario and ask: "What hazardous attitude is this pilot exhibiting?"
- **Example:** "The pilot decides to buzz his friend's house to show off." -> **Macho**.
- **Example:** "The weather is bad, but the pilot says, 'My instructor flew in this last week, I'll be fine.'" -> **Invulnerability**.

    A[Situation Arises] --> B{Hazardous Attitude Triggered?}
    B -- Yes: "I gotta act NOW!" --> C[Stop!]
    C --> D[Identify: Impulsivity]
    D --> E[Apply Antidote: "Not so fast. Think first."]
    E --> F[Sound Decision]
    B -- No --> F
```

## Study Drills
1. What is the antidote for "Resignation"?
2. A pilot scoffs at a checklist, saying "I know this plane backwards and forwards." What attitude is this?
3. Which attitude is often associated with "Get-there-itis" (External Pressure)? (Often a mix of Impulsivity and Invulnerability).
