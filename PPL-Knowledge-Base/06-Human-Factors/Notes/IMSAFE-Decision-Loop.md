# IMSAFE & Decision Loop

## What it is
IMSAFE is your personal checklist (Illness, Medication, Stress, Alcohol, Fatigue, Emotion). Combine it with the DECIDE decision model to keep personal minimums in check.

## Why it matters
A DPE wants to hear you say “I used IMSAFE before flight” and explain how that informed your go/no-go decision.

## How it shows up on a checkride
- **Q:** “When do you stop a flight in progress?” **A:** Any IMSAFE flag, unexpected weather, or system failure triggers the DECIDE loop and may require diversion.
- **Q:** “What does the DECIDE model look like?” **A:** Detect hazards, Estimate risk, Choose action, Identify controls, Do it, Evaluate results.
- **Q:** “How do you use IMSAFE before passenger flights?” **A:** Apply IMSAFE to yourself and any PIC candidate; don’t let stress or fatigue lower your personal minimums.

## Common mistakes
- Running IMSAFE mentally without documenting or discussing it; say it out loud or log it.
- Treating medication status as irrelevant; even OTC meds can degrade judgment.
- Halting DECIDE at “Choose” without implementing the mitigation or evaluating success.
