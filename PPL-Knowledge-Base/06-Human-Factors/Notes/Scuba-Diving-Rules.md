# Scuba Diving & Flying

## The Risk: Decompression Sickness ("The Bends")
- Nitrogen dissolves in the blood under pressure (diving).
- As you climb (lower pressure), the nitrogen bubbles out (like opening a soda).
- Bubbles in joints = Pain. Bubbles in brain/lungs = Incapacitation/Death.

## The Rules (AIM 8-1-5)

| Dive Type | Wait Time (Up to 8,000 ft MSL) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Non-Decompression Stop Dive** | Wait **12 Hours** |
| **Decompression Stop Dive** | Wait **24 Hours** |
| **Flight ABOVE 8,000 ft** | Wait **24 Hours** (All cases) |

## Checkride Angle
- **Scenario:** "You did a shallow reef dive this morning (no stops). Can we fly home at 5,500 ft this afternoon (6 hours later)?"
- **Answer:** No. Wait at least 12 hours.

## Study Drills
1. If you had to make a "decompression stop" while ascending from a dive, how long must you wait to fly? (24 hours).
