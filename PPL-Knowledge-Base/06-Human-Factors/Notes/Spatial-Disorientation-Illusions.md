# Spatial Disorientation & Illusions

## Definition
When your brain (Vestibular System + Vision + Proprioception) disagrees with reality.

## The Vestibular System
- The inner ear (semicircular canals) detects *acceleration*, not constant velocity.
- If you turn gradually, the fluid settles, and you *feel* straight and level (even if banking).

## Common Illusions (ICEFLAGS)
1.  **Inversion:** Climb to level off feels like tumbling backwards. (Pilot pushes nose down -> Dive).
2.  **Coriolis:** Head movement in a turn creates a tumbling sensation. (Keep head still!).
3.  **Elevator:** Updraft causes upward acceleration. Feels like a climb. (Pilot pushes nose down).
4.  **False Horizon:** Lights or clouds look like the horizon but aren't.
5.  **Leans:** A gradual turn is unnoticed. A quick correction feels like a turn in the opposite direction.
6.  **Autokinesis:** A static light in the dark appears to move.
7.  **Graveyard Spiral:** In a long turn, you feel level. You see altitude dropping. You pull back. This tightens the turn and increases Gs. (Spiral dives).
8.  **Somatogravic:** Rapid acceleration (takeoff) feels like pitching up. (Pilot pushes nose down).

## The Antidote
**TRUST YOUR INSTRUMENTS.**
- If your body says "Turn Right" but the Attitude Indicator says "Level," believe the gauge.

## Checkride Angle
- **Scenario:** "It's a dark night over water. You take off and feel like you are pitching up steep. What do you do?"
- **Answer:** Cross-check the Attitude Indicator and Airspeed. Do not push the nose down based on feeling (Somatogravic Illusion).

## Study Drills
1. Which illusion makes you feel like you are tumbling backwards? (Inversion).
2. What causes the "Leans"? (The fluid in the ear settling during a prolonged turn).
