# PHAK Chapter 16: Aeromedical Factors

Your body is not designed for flight. It is designed for 1G at sea level. This chapter covers how the environment kills you if you aren't careful.

## Key Concepts
- **Hypoxia:** Oxygen starvation.
- **Hyperventilation:** Too much breathing (CO2 loss).
- **Illusions:** Vestibular (Inner Ear) and Visual.
- **Alcohol/Drugs:** The 8 hour rule.
- **Scuba Diving:** Nitrogen bubbles (The Bends).

## Study Notes
- [[06-Human-Factors/Notes/Hypoxia-Types-Symptoms|Hypoxia & Hyperventilation]]: The 4 types and how to spot them.
- [[06-Human-Factors/Notes/Spatial-Disorientation-Illusions|Spatial Disorientation]]: The Leans, Graveyard Spiral, Coriolis.
- [[06-Human-Factors/Notes/Scuba-Diving-Rules|Scuba Diving & Flying]]: Wait times.

## Checkride Focus
- **Symptoms:** "Your fingernails are blue. What is it?" (Hypoxia).
- **Treatment:** "You are hyperventilating. What do you do?" (Talk aloud, slow breathing).
- **The Bends:** "You dove 20ft this morning. Can you fly home at 8,000ft?" (No. Wait 12-24 hours).
