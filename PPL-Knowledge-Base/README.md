# PPL Knowledge Base (Obsidian)

Open `obsidian-aviation/` as your Obsidian vault; this knowledge base lives under `PPL-Knowledge-Base/`.

## Structure

- `00-Study-Plan/`: weekly plan, ACS mapping, progress tracking
- `01-08/`: your refined notes (one concept per note)
- `PDFs/`: FAA PDFs (PHAK, FAR/AIM, ACS) and your POH
- `Templates/`: note templates you can apply in Obsidian
- `Inbox/`: quick captures to sort later

## Getting started

1. Put PDFs in `PDFs/` (or create symlinks).
2. Start new notes from `Templates/Concept Note.md`.
3. Keep each note mapped to at least one ACS task in the frontmatter.

## Recent work log

- Built the regulations concept index plus ARROW, weather minima, right-of-way, fuel, equipment/INOP, currency, and logging notes with ACS tags, diagrams, and oral-drill structure.
- Added the Weather Go/No-Go decision-tree note with three diagrams, misconceptions, an oral drill, and links to the ADM/weather notes.
- Grew the oral QA bank with 60 regulation/weather knowledge/scenario/trick drills, all tagged with topic + ACS references for quick practice.
- Repeatedly updated the home index and ACS mapping so every new note is discoverable and connected to its section.
- Rolled through the next PHAK chapters via the Codex prompts, spinning Concept Notes for each major topic and tagging them in `ACS-Mapping`.
- Imported key AIM and FAR/AIM guidance into the vault (landing pattern diagrams, communication QAs) while keeping the regulations index up to date.
- Polished the oral QA bank with scenario-based questions from new chapters and revisited the MISCONCEPTIONS lists after each topic review.

## TODO for next sessions

1. Plan next study session topics.
