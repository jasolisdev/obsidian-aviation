# Oral Q&A

## Regulations (1-10)
1. **Q:** What privileges does your private pilot certificate grant under FAR 61.113?
   **A:** Act as PIC carrying passengers or cargo for personal, business, or charity reasons, share pro rata expenses when authorized, and no compensation for the flight itself unless the flight fits a limited cost-sharing exception.
2. **Q:** Which documents must be aboard the airplane for legal day VFR flight?
   **A:** Airworthiness certificate, registration certificate, operating limitations (POH or placards), weight & balance data; also radio station license and medical certificate if required for the airspace you are entering.
3. **Q:** How long is a first-class medical valid for a private pilot under age 40?
   **A:** 60 months (5 years) for operations not requiring higher class; under 40 first-class is valid for private privileges for 60 months before downgrading to third-class timing.
4. **Q:** Name two limitations placed on student pilots.
   **A:** Cannot carry passengers, cannot fly for compensation, must have instructor endorsement for solo flight and cross-countries, and must remain within 25 NM (or as authorized) and into airspace only with proper training.
5. **Q:** What recent experience must you have to carry passengers?
   **A:** Within the preceding 90 days, three takeoffs and landings in the same category and class, and night passengers require three night takeoffs and landings to a full stop.
6. **Q:** What preflight action is required by FAR 91.103?
   **A:** Review weather reports/forecasts, fuel requirements, alternates, runway lengths, and any known traffic delays before each flight.
7. **Q:** How do you stay legal with inspections and maintenance?
   **A:** Maintain logbook entries for annual, 100-hour (if required), ELT, transponder, and altimeter inspections and ensure discrepancies are signed off in the maintenance log.
8. **Q:** Explain the right-of-way rules at an uncontrolled airport.
   **A:** Aircraft on final approach or landing have right of way over others, and in the traffic pattern follow standard entry; aircraft must yield to those already in the pattern and to those to your right when converging.
9. **Q:** What are the alcohol and drug limitations for pilots?
   **A:** No flying within 8 hours of alcohol consumption, no operation with a blood alcohol level of 0.04% or greater, and absolutely no flying while using illegal drugs or while prescription meds impair you.
10. **Q:** What security responsibilities does the PIC carry?
   **A:** The PIC must ensure the aircraft is not operated in a careless or reckless way, be alert for suspicious persons or items, inspect the aircraft for tampering, and comply with TSA regulations like 49 CFR 1544 when at security-sensitive airports.

## Aerodynamics (11-20)
11. **Q:** What does dihedral do for an airplane?
   **A:** Dihedral adds roll stability by generating more lift on the lower wing during a bank, encouraging the airplane to level itself.
12. **Q:** How does load factor change at 60° of bank in level flight?
   **A:** It increases to 2 Gs, so the wing sees twice the weight and the stall speed increases even though airspeed is constant.
13. **Q:** Describe ground effect and when you feel it.
   **A:** Ground effect is the cushion of higher pressure beneath the wings within about one wingspan of the runway; it reduces induced drag and can cause you to float if you flare too high.
14. **Q:** What is the best glide speed and when do you use it?
   **A:** The airspeed that gives the greatest distance per altitude lost, used during engine failures to maximize glide range.
15. **Q:** How does extending flaps affect lift and drag?
   **A:** Flaps increase camber, raising lift, but they also significantly increase drag, which lowers the best L/D ratio and allows you to slow down for approach.
16. **Q:** What does the V<sub>g</sub> diagram show you?
   **A:** It plots load factor versus airspeed, showing the structural limits and stall lines for different bank angles so you avoid overstressing the airplane.
17. **Q:** Explain the difference between static and dynamic stability.
   **A:** Static stability is the airplane’s initial tendency to return to steady flight after a disturbance, while dynamic stability describes whether it actually damps out over time.
18. **Q:** How does a spin develop and how do you recover?
   **A:** Asymmetric stall produces autorotation; recover via the PARE sequence (Power idle, Ailerons neutral, Rudder opposite the spin, Elevator down to break the stall) then recover to level flight.
19. **Q:** What happens to stall speed as weight increases?
   **A:** Stall speed increases because higher weight requires more lift, so you reach the critical angle of attack at a higher speed.
20. **Q:** What purpose does an angle-of-attack indicator serve during a checkride?
   **A:** It gives you direct awareness of proximity to the critical AoA regardless of airspeed changes, reinforcing you can avoid a stall.

## Aircraft Systems (21-30)
21. **Q:** What indications do you get from a pitot-static failure?
   **A:** A blocked pitot with open drain causes the airspeed to behave like an altimeter, rising with climbs; a blocked static port freezes altimeter, VSI shows zero, and airspeed acts erratically.
22. **Q:** How do you recognize a vacuum pump failure in a steam-gauge airplane?
   **A:** The attitude indicator or heading indicator will start to tumble or drift and may be flagged with a vacuum warning light.
23. **Q:** Why do you apply carburetor heat in flight?
   **A:** To melt any ice forming in the carburetor throat when visible moisture exists and temperatures are favorable for icing; it also increases manifold pressure slightly and richens the mixture.
24. **Q:** What is the maximum allowable magneto drop during a run-up?
   **A:** The drop should not exceed 125 RPM difference between each magneto and the full-run engine speed, nor should you lose more than 50 RPM between the highest and lowest magneto.
25. **Q:** How do you respond to a generator warning light while climbing?
   **A:** Reduce electrical load, turn off unnecessary equipment, monitor the ammeter, and land at the nearest suitable airport if charging does not stabilize.
26. **Q:** What does the ammeter show at engine start versus cruise?
   **A:** It shows a discharge as the starter draws current, then a positive charge once the alternator is online.
27. **Q:** What is the fuel pump’s role in a piston airplane?
   **A:** It delivers fuel from the tank to the engine, usually by a mechanical pump on the engine; an electric boost pump provides redundancy for takeoff/combat ice.
28. **Q:** Why do you lean the mixture as you climb to cruise altitude?
   **A:** Air density drops with altitude so you must reduce fuel flow to maintain optimal fuel-air ratio and prevent fouling.
29. **Q:** What is your priority list during an electrical failure?
   **A:** Avionics first (master switch off, essential radios on), then landing lights/lighting as needed, and last ensure you maintain safe flight with backup instruments.
30. **Q:** What information does the annunciator panel give you?
   **A:** It lights up to warn of system failures (oil pressure, alternator, landing gear), allowing you to cross-check instruments and take immediate action.

## Weather (31-55)
31. **Q:** What is a METAR and what frequency does it typically follow?
   **A:** A METAR is a routine hourly weather observation that reports current conditions, usually issued about 55 minutes past the hour unless special updates (SPECI) are needed.
32. **Q:** How does a TAF differ from a METAR?
   **A:** A TAF is a forecast for a specific airport covering 24 or 30 hours with groups like PROB and TEMPO describing expected changes, whereas a METAR is the present observation.
33. **Q:** What is the meaning of `FM` and `TEMPO` in a TAF?
   **A:** `FM` denotes a rapid and sustained change beginning at the listed time; `TEMPO` signals temporary fluctuations lasting less than an hour at a time.
34. **Q:** How do you read a SIGMET from a briefing?
   **A:** It warns of widespread hazardous weather (turbulence, icing, thunderstorms, volcanic ash) that affects all aircraft but especially non-gauge; note affected altitudes and valid period.
35. **Q:** What is the operational difference between an AIRMET and a SIGMET?
   **A:** AIRMETs cover less severe phenomena for smaller aircraft (IFR, mountain obscuration, turbulence), while SIGMETs are more severe, usually for all aircraft (e.g., severe icing, tornados).
36. **Q:** How do you determine icing potential from the METAR/TAF numbers?
   **A:** Look for freezing-level temps between 0°C and -20°C with visible moisture (clouds, precipitation) and note if TAF includes icing notes or if the temperature/dew point spread is small.
37. **Q:** What is the significance of `BKN` vs `FEW` on a METAR?
   **A:** `BKN` means broken clouds (5/8 to 7/8 coverage) and can imply low ceilings, while `FEW` is 1/8 to 2/8 and usually acceptable for VFR.
38. **Q:** Why does a DPE ask about the `WS` and `WC` groups on a wind shear report?
   **A:** They describe the location and altitude of wind shear or LLWS; you need to know where it will affect takeoff/landing.
39. **Q:** What do the columns `QNH` and `Altim` mean on a METAR?
   **A:** `QNH` is the altimeter setting in inches of mercury for local altimeter adjustments, ensuring clearance above obstacles.
40. **Q:** How do you use radar summary charts in a briefing?
   **A:** Identify convective cells, precipitation intensity, and movement to determine safe routing around thunderstorms.
41. **Q:** What do the prefixes `TSRA` or `SHRA` tell you in a METAR?
   **A:** TSRA denotes thunderstorms and rain—expect lightning and turbulence—while SHRA indicates showers, which imply convective activity.
42. **Q:** What is the difference between `VFR` and `MVFR` ceilings?
   **A:** VFR ceilings are at least 1,000 feet AGL with 3 SM visibility or better; MVFR ranges from 1,000 to 3,000 ft and/or 3-5 SM visibility.
43. **Q:** How do you interpret a TAF that ends in `PROB30`?
   **A:** There is a 30% chance of the specified conditions occurring during the stated time window.
44. **Q:** What does `CB` in the sky condition mean?
   **A:** Cumulonimbus, which indicates thunderstorms, significant vertical development, and possible hail/lightning.
45. **Q:** How do you detect wind shear on approach from a METAR or ATIS?
   **A:** Listen for wind shear alerts or variable wind speeds/directions, especially gusts exceeding 15 knots; ATIS will often state “wind shear advisory in effect.”
46. **Q:** What role do pilot reports (PIREPs) play in evaluating weather?
   **A:** They provide first-hand reports of turbulence, icing, or visibility along your route, offering situational updates not yet reflected in published forecasts.
47. **Q:** What is the icing key temperature range you should memorize for VFR flying?
   **A:** Between +5°C and -20°C with visible moisture, though the highest risk is near -5°C to -10°C.
48. **Q:** How do you handle a SIGMET for turbulence that covers your route?
   **A:** Avoid the area entirely by rerouting or delaying; explain the change in your briefing and log it for the DPE.
49. **Q:** Why is wind shear dangerous at low altitude?
   **A:** It can cause sudden losses or gains in airspeed and altitude, threatening control during takeoff or landing.
50. **Q:** What does `M` before the temperature mean in a METAR?
   **A:** It denotes negative Celsius (minus), so `M05` is -5°C.
51. **Q:** How do you incorporate a TAF for your alternate airport?
   **A:** Ensure weather stays within your personal minimums during the required timeframe by checking the TAF for the alternate and factoring in protective fuel.
52. **Q:** What is a convective SIGMET and what triggers it?
   **A:** It warns of severe thunderstorms, including tornadoes, hail of at least 3/4 inch, or winds over 50 knots; it's issued for convective activity that affects large areas.
53. **Q:** How can you tell if a TAF is trending toward IFR afterwards?
   **A:** Spot lower ceilings or reduced visibility times and plan to return or divert before the IFR window if you are VFR-only.
54. **Q:** Why should you always ask for an updated briefing if weather has changed after your flight planning?
   **A:** Because METARs/TAFs can change quickly and new SIGMETs or TFRs might be issued, altering your go/no-go decision.
55. **Q:** What does `CLR` mean in the sky condition section of an ATIS?
   **A:** It means the sky is clear—no clouds below 12,000 ft and no towering cumulus.

## Navigation (56-80)
56. **Q:** How can you tell Class B boundaries on a sectional chart?
   **A:** They are solid blue lines with identifying numbers showing top and bottom altitudes; the outer shelf is labeled (e.g., “30/10” for 3,000 ft top, 1,000 ft floor).
57. **Q:** Describe the Class C airspace structure.
   **A:** It has an inner core (usually 5 NM radius up to 4,000 ft AGL) and an outer shelf (10 NM radius) that typically starts at 1,200 ft AGL; you must establish two-way comms before entry.
58. **Q:** What clearance do you need before entering Class B?
   **A:** Specific ATC clearance that uses the word “cleared,” and you must also have a Mode C transponder and be on the published squawk.
59. **Q:** What are VFR cloud clearance requirements in Class G below 1,200 AGL during the day?
   **A:** 1 statute mile visibility and clear of clouds.
60. **Q:** When is Mode C altitude reporting required?
   **A:** Within Class A, B, C, and certain airspace areas, plus above 10,000 ft MSL (except class B) and within 30 NM Mode C veil of Class B.
61. **Q:** What does a dashed magenta line mean on a sectional?
   **A:** A dashed magenta indicates Class E airspace extending upward from 700 ft AGL.
62. **Q:** How do you calculate your wind correction angle for pilotage?
   **A:** Use the wind triangle: determine wind direction/speed, plot true course, solve for heading by adding or subtracting the required crab angle.
63. **Q:** Why do you fly to a VOR radial and then track a reciprocal course?
   **A:** Station passage ensures you have passed the VOR, so you switch to the inbound or outbound radial reliably and avoid reverse sensing.
64. **Q:** What is RAIM and why is it important?
   **A:** Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring checks GPS satellite consistency; without RAIM, you cannot rely on GPS for navigation.
65. **Q:** What do you do if RAIM fails en route?
   **A:** Cross-check with other navaids, notify ATC if in controlled airspace, and consider diverting to an airport with reliable navigation aids.
66. **Q:** How do you identify a VOR/DME station on a sectional?
   **A:** The VOR identifier is shown along with the DME, often with a tick mark on the station symbol and labeled frequency/distance.
67. **Q:** What is the proper lost communications procedure in VFR conditions?
   **A:** Squawk 7600, try to contact ATC, continue VFR while staying clear of IFR traffic, and land as soon as practicable with any airspace considerations.
68. **Q:** How often should you check GPS databases?
   **A:** Before each flight, especially for navigation waypoints and airspace boundaries; maintain the published database cycle on your device.
69. **Q:** What is the purpose of the VFR sectional’s airport traffic pattern indicators?
   **A:** They show runway orientation, circuit direction, towered vs. non-towered info, and whether the airport is flooded with special operations (heliports, gliders).
70. **Q:** How do compass errors affect navigation and how do you correct them?
   **A:** Errors include deviation (magnetic interference) and variation (difference between true and magnetic north); correct by referring to a compass chart or by adding/subtracting variation.
71. **Q:** What is the recommended VFR cruising altitude for easterly and westerly courses?
   **A:** Odd thousands plus 500 ft (3,500, 5,500) for eastbound (0°–179°) and even thousands plus 500 ft (4,500, 6,500) for westbound (180°–359°).
72. **Q:** How do you file a VFR flight plan and when must you close it?
   **A:** File via FAA Flight Service or online, include route, altitude, ETAs, and close it after landing by calling the facility or through electronic means.
73. **Q:** What do the numbers near the VOR symbol (e.g., 46/11) represent?
   **A:** The floor and ceiling of the Class B or C shelf (e.g., 4,600 ft top, 1,100 ft floor) or service volume altitudes.
74. **Q:** How do you plan a cross-country using pilotage and VORs?
   **A:** Plot legs between prominent checkpoints, note VOR radials and distances, compute headings after accounting for wind, and verify with GPS or DME.
75. **Q:** Why should you request a Standard Weather Briefing from Flight Service?
   **A:** It provides complete info, including METARs, TAFs, NOTAMs, PIREPs, SIGMETs, and a risk assessment, which you can log to show CFIs/DPEs you briefed properly.
76. **Q:** What is the VOR service volume for a terminal VOR?
   **A:** Typically up to 1,000 ft but effective service volume extends up to 25-40 NM depending on altitude; check the instrument approach plate for specifics.
77. **Q:** How do you use GPS to confirm you are tracking the correct airway?
   **A:** Verify the GPS database airway name, look for the intended course, and cross-check with the CDI deviation flag.
78. **Q:** What is the easiest way to determine if you are inside TFR/Prohibited Area?
   **A:** Check NOTAMs or sectional TFR markings (blue hatched areas) before entering, and always call the controlling agency if in doubt.
79. **Q:** How do you maintain situational awareness when transitioning through complex airspace?
   **A:** Monitor position via VOR/GPS, listen to the appropriate frequency, and keep the sectional/chart easily visible in the cockpit.
80. **Q:** How do compass deviations vary with heading, and how do you find the corrective value?
   **A:** Deviation depends on local magnetism; use the deviation card (found near the compass) to add or subtract the values for the heading you are flying.

## Human Factors (81-95)
81. **Q:** What does IMSAFE stand for?
   **A:** Illness, Medication, Stress, Alcohol, Fatigue, Emotion—use it as a preflight self-check.
82. **Q:** How does the PAVE checklist help before every flight?
   **A:** It reminds you to evaluate the Pilot (IMSAFE), Aircraft (airworthiness, performance), enVironment (weather, terrain), and External pressures (scheduling, passengers).
83. **Q:** Describe the DECIDE model.
   **A:** Detect hazards, Estimate risks, Choose a course of action, Identify best controls, Do the solution, Evaluate the result.
84. **Q:** What are common signs of fatigue you should mention to the DPE?
   **A:** Slowed reaction time, yawning, trouble focusing, irritability, and degraded memory—if any appear, reschedule or postpone the flight.
85. **Q:** What is the startle effect and how do you manage it?
   **A:** A sudden unexpected event causes instinctive reactions; manage it by trimming, stabilizing the airplane, and then assessing the situation calmly.
86. **Q:** How would you recognize the leans in flight?
   **A:** You feel like wings-level but you are banked; you might sense a roll to level when instruments still show bank.
87. **Q:** What is the recovery technique for spatial disorientation (the leans)?
   **A:** Trust the instruments, level the wings, then reference attitude indicator to regain the desired flight path.
88. **Q:** What are the dangers of carbon monoxide exposure in the cockpit?
   **A:** Headache, dizziness, impaired judgment; respond by using the cabin heat properly, opening vents, and landing if symptoms continue.
89. **Q:** How can you handle stress before a flight?
   **A:** Recognize the stressor, consider delegating tasks, keep a clear go/no-go plan, and delay the flight if stress exceeds your personal minimums.
90. **Q:** What happens when you are under time pressure?
   **A:** You may rush decisions; counter it with a realistic go/no-go plan and communicate delays to passengers or instructors.
91. **Q:** What is complacency and how does it show up during checkrides?
   **A:** It is overconfidence in automation or routine procedures; stay engaged, monitor instruments, and keep scanning even after repeated maneuvers.
92. **Q:** How do you identify hazardous attitudes and apply the antidotes?
   **A:** Recognize attitudes like anti-authority or impulsivity; apply the antidote (e.g., “Follow the rules” or “Think first”) and verbalize it if asked.
93. **Q:** Why is a sterile cockpit important during critical phases?
   **A:** It eliminates distractions so you focus on the takeoff, climb, approach, and landing.
94. **Q:** How do you enforce your personal minimums during a go/no-go decision?
   **A:** Set conservative thresholds for weather, fuel, and pilot readiness earlier, and don’t let passengers or schedules push you beyond them.
95. **Q:** What is the best way to brief passengers on human factor concerns?
   **A:** Explain your IMSAFE status, the plan, expected durations, and what decisions you might make if personal minimums trigger (e.g., divert, cancel).

## Performance & Weight/Balance (96-115)
96. **Q:** What is density altitude and how do you compute it in general terms?
   **A:** Density altitude is pressure altitude corrected for nonstandard temperature; you calculate pressure altitude and then add/subtract temperature deviation from standard to get the altitude the airplane “feels.”
97. **Q:** How does a high temperature affect takeoff distance?
   **A:** It raises density altitude, which reduces lift and increases ground roll and climb distance.
98. **Q:** What weather factor shortens your landing distance?
   **A:** A strong headwind reduces groundspeed and shortens the landing roll.
99. **Q:** Why do you compute weight & balance before every flight?
   **A:** To ensure total weight and CG remain within POH limits, protecting stability and control.
100. **Q:** What does the CG envelope show?
   **A:** Acceptable forward and aft CG limits across different weights so you maintain controllability and stall margins.
101. **Q:** When adding baggage, what do you do with the arm?
   **A:** Multiply the weight by the arm to get the moment, then include it in the total moment sum before dividing by total weight.
102. **Q:** How do you use the POH takeoff chart when given runway pressure altitude, temperature, and weight?
   **A:** Find the pressure altitude line, move across to the weight curve, and then adjust for headwind, slope, or runway surface as noted.
103. **Q:** How does crossing into high density altitude affect climb rate?
   **A:** Climb performance decreases because the engine makes less power and the wings produce less lift.
104. **Q:** Why do you add a safety margin to computed landing distance?
   **A:** Factors like pilot technique, runway condition, and gusts can degrade performance, so you typically plan for at least 50% more than the POH value.
105. **Q:** What effect does airplane weight have on stall speed?
   **A:** Higher weight increases stall speed while lower weight decreases it.
106. **Q:** What is the procedure to compute the moment of a passenger?
   **A:** Multiply passenger weight by the assigned arm (from the POH) and add the result to the total moment.
107. **Q:** How do you determine whether the CG is within limits after fueling?
   **A:** Recompute total weight and CG including the fuel load and compare to the envelope; check forward and aft limit lines for the current gross weight.
108. **Q:** Why is runway slope included in the performance calculations?
   **A:** Uphill slopes require more distance for takeoff and slow the landing roll, while downhill slopes shorten takeoff but lengthen landing.
109. **Q:** How do flaps affect landing ground roll?
   **A:** Proper flap setting reduces stall speed and allows a steeper approach, reducing ground roll; too much flap may balloon.
110. **Q:** What is the impact of a tailwind on takeoff performance?
   **A:** It increases ground roll and decreases climb gradient; always avoid tailwind takeoffs when possible.
111. **Q:** How do you account for a wet runway in performance planning?
   **A:** Apply the POH’s wet runway factors and plan for increased landing distance, plus avoid braking hard to prevent hydroplaning.
112. **Q:** How does propeller efficiency change with density altitude?
   **A:** Propeller slipstream spreads out and produces less thrust at high density altitude, reducing acceleration.
113. **Q:** What is your go/no-go decision if the calculated takeoff ground roll exceeds runway length?
   **A:** Do not depart; either reduce weight, wait for cooler conditions, or choose a longer runway.
114. **Q:** How does weight shift affect balance during flight?
   **A:** Adding or moving weight aft shifts CG aft, reducing stability; moving weight forward increases stability but can raise stall speed.
115. **Q:** What documentation do you keep to prove your weight & balance calculation?
   **A:** Save the completed form or log entry with weights, moments, total CG, and compare with POH envelope for the DPE.

## Flight Planning & ADM (116-130)
116. **Q:** What does a solid go/no-go decision look like?
   **A:** It combines a complete briefing of weather, NOTAMs, aircraft performance, passenger readiness, and reserves; if any critical piece falls below your personal minimums, you cancel or delay.
117. **Q:** How do you determine fuel requirements for a VFR flight?
   **A:** Plan for fuel to fly to the first airport plus 30 minutes reserve for day VFR, accounting for headwinds and any expected delay.
118. **Q:** When do you designate an alternate airport for VFR?
   **A:** When your destination forecast could drop below minimums near arrival time, set an alternate with known good weather and runways.
119. **Q:** How do NOTAMs factor into your flight plan?
   **A:** You must review them for runway closures, taxiway issues, TFRs, or nav aid outages and incorporate them into your route or dropout options.
120. **Q:** What key points do you cover in the passenger briefing?
   **A:** Seat belt use, emergency exits, brace position, use of headsets, and how to communicate during emergencies.
121. **Q:** How does the PAVE checklist tie into ADM?
   **A:** It organizes risk factors across pilot, aircraft, environment, and external pressures, so you can identify hazards before making decisions.
122. **Q:** Why do you monitor updated weather after filing a flight plan?
   **A:** Conditions can deteriorate quickly, and new AIRMETs or SIGMETs may require you to land earlier or divert; keep the briefing current.
123. **Q:** How do you handle learning about a new TFR while en route?
   **A:** Divert or reroute to stay outside the TFR, communicate with ATC if in controlled airspace, and note the updated plan for your DPE.
124. **Q:** When should you cancel a VFR flight plan?
   **A:** Immediately upon landing, or if you must land at a different airport, call Flight Service or the facility that opened it to close it.
125. **Q:** What is the plan if you inadvertently enter IMC while VFR?
   **A:** Stay calm, declare an emergency, transition to instrument scan, maintain heading and altitude, and request vectors if able.
126. **Q:** How do you plan for thunderstorms when filing a VFR course?
   **A:** Avoid them entirely, reroute around the convective area, and include extra fuel for longer distances.
127. **Q:** How do you select an alternate that’s still viable if your destination weather worsens?
   **A:** Pick an airport with published instrument procedures, good weather, and services—even though you are VFR, it adds options if you need to go IFR.
128. **Q:** What is the benefit of briefing passengers about go/no-go decisions?
   **A:** They understand why you might delay or cancel due to safety, reducing pressure to fly in marginal conditions.
129. **Q:** How do you document your risk assessment for the DPE?
   **A:** Keep a written note or log entry of IMSAFE, weather hazards, and the mitigations you chose (delayed departure, alternate, reroute).
130. **Q:** What steps do you take to maintain situational awareness when planning multiple legs?
   **A:** Update weather for each leg, review airspace along the route, keep navigation logs current, and confirm fuel status before each departure.

## Emergencies & Procedures (131-140)
131. **Q:** Describe the first steps if you experience an engine failure after takeoff.
   **A:** Pitch for best glide, select a safe landing area ahead, lower the nose to maintain speed, and attempt restart only after gliding clear of obstacles.
132. **Q:** What does the emergency landing pattern look like?
   **A:** Enter a traffic pattern toward your selected landing area, fly the “low key, base, final” while gliding at best glide speed, and land with flaps as appropriate.
133. **Q:** How do you handle an electrical failure in IMC with limited instruments?
   **A:** Use backup instruments, request assistance from ATC for vectors, and plan for the nearest suitable airport while prioritizing control of the airplane.
134. **Q:** What do you do if a fire starts during taxi?
   **A:** Cut off fuel, shut down the engine, evacuate the aircraft, and use a fire extinguisher if safe to do so.
135. **Q:** How do you perform a forced landing without power?
   **A:** Maintain best glide, pick a safe landing field, plan your touchdown point, and execute a flaps and airspeed profile that gives you control to stall gently.
136. **Q:** What’s the checklist for an in-flight fire from the engine?
   **A:** Mixture idle, fuel pump off, fuel selector off, master off, cabin heat/vent closed, and land as soon as possible.
137. **Q:** How do you handle a bird strike on takeoff roll?
   **A:** Abort if sufficient runway remains; otherwise continue, climb gently, check for damage, and land at the nearest suitable airport.
138. **Q:** What is the best glide speed and why is it important in emergencies?
   **A:** The speed that gives maximum glide distance, critical to reach a safe forced landing site.
139. **Q:** What action do you take if you see low oil pressure after takeoff?

    **A:** Part 141 allows a PPL minimum of 35 hours due to its stricter, FAA-approved syllabus structure.
276. **Q:** Scenario: A friend asks you to fly a package to another city for $500. You won't carry passengers, just the box. Can you do it? #regs (ACS I.A.K.1)
    **A:** No. That is "cargo for compensation or hire," which requires a Commercial certificate and usually a Part 135 operating certificate.
277. **Q:** Scenario: You are a private pilot and a salesman. Can you fly yourself to a client meeting? #regs (ACS I.A.K.1)
    **A:** Yes, provided the flight is incidental to your business and you are not carrying passengers or property for compensation.
278. **Q:** Scenario: You discover you have high blood pressure before a flight. Your medical is valid. Can you fly? #medical (ACS I.B.K.1)
    **A:** No. FAR 61.53 prohibits acting as PIC if you know of any medical condition that would make you unable to meet the requirements of your medical certificate.
279. **Q:** What is a "Complex" airplane and what do you need to fly it? #regs (ACS I.A.K.1)
    **A:** An airplane with retractable gear, flaps, and a controllable pitch propeller; you need a one-time logbook endorsement from an instructor.
280. **Q:** What is a "High Performance" airplane? #regs (ACS I.A.K.1)
    **A:** An airplane with an engine of *more than* 200 horsepower. Requires a logbook endorsement.
281. **Q (Trick):** Is a 200 HP airplane "High Performance"? #regs (ACS I.A.K.1)
    **A:** Trick: No. The rule says "more than 200 HP." Exactly 200 HP is not high performance.
282. **Q:** Can a Student Pilot fly inside Class B airspace? #regs (ACS I.A.K.1)
    **A:** Only with a specific logbook endorsement for that specific Class B area, and some Class B airports strictly prohibit student pilots.
283. **Q:** Scenario: You pass your checkride in a Cessna 172 (single-engine). Can you fly a Piper Archer (single-engine) without an endorsement? #regs (ACS I.A.K.1)
    **A:** Yes, both are Category: Airplane, Class: Single-Engine Land. No additional endorsement needed (unless it's High Perf/Complex).
284. **Q:** What happens to your medical privileges if you turn 40 *during* the validity period? #medical (ACS I.B.K.1)
    **A:** The duration is determined by your age *on the date of the examination*. Turning 40 later does not shorten the current certificate's validity.
285. **Q (Trick):** Your medical expires on June 15th. Can you fly on June 20th? #medical (ACS I.B.K.1)
    **A:** Trick: Medicals expire on the *last day* of the month. If issued in June (5 years ago), it is valid until June 30th. So yes, you can fly on the 20th.

    **A:** Invulnerability ("It won't happen to me"). Antidote: "It could happen to me."
288. **Q:** Scenario: You are late for a wedding and the weather is deteriorating. You feel pressure to continue. What attitude is this? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** Impulsivity (feeling the need to do something quickly) or "Get-there-itis" leading to Invulnerability. Antidote: "Not so fast. Think first."
289. **Q:** What does the "E" in PAVE stand for? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** External Pressures (meetings, passengers, deadlines).
290. **Q:** How do you define "Risk" vs. "Hazard"? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** A Hazard is a real event or condition (e.g., a thunderstorm). Risk is the future impact of that hazard (e.g., loss of control, turbulence).
291. **Q:** Walk me through the DECIDE model for an engine roughness scenario. #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** **D**etect the roughness. **E**stimate the risk (engine failure). **C**hoose a safe outcome (land soon). **I**dentify the nearest airport. **D**o the diversion. **E**valuate if the roughness is stable or worsening.
292. **Q:** What are the 5 Ps of Single-Pilot Resource Management? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.3)
    **A:** Plan, Plane, Pilot, Passengers, Programming.
293. **Q:** What is "Resignation" and its antidote? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** "What's the use?" / Antidote: "I am not helpless. I can make a difference."
294. **Q:** Scenario: A passenger starts getting airsick. How do you use them as a resource? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.3)
    **A:** Give them a job (look for traffic), open air vents, keep them looking outside. Do not ignore them.
295. **Q:** What is the difference between Acute and Chronic stress? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** Acute is short-term (fight or flight). Chronic is long-term (life pressures) and is much more dangerous for pilots as it lowers performance thresholds.
296. **Q:** Why is "Anti-Authority" dangerous even for rule-following pilots? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** It can manifest as disregarding "suggestions" from ATC or the POH when under pressure. Antidote: "Follow the rules. They are usually right."
297. **Q:** How does fatigue affect pilot performance? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** It mimics alcohol impairment: slowed reaction time, narrowed attention (tunnel vision), and acceptance of lower standards.
298. **Q:** What is "Confirmation Bias" in flight planning? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** Seeking out information that supports your decision to go (e.g., one good METAR) while ignoring information that says no-go (e.g., 5 bad TAFs).
299. **Q:** When should you use the "5 Ps" check? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.3)
    **A:** At critical decision points: Preflight, before Takeoff, Top of Climb/Cruise, before Descent, and before Approach.
300. **Q:** What is the first step in neutralizing a hazardous attitude? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** Recognition. You have to label the thought ("I'm being impulsive") before you can apply the antidote.
301. **Q:** Scenario: Your GPS fails. You feel panic rising. What do you do? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.3)

302. **Q:** What is "Automation Surprise"? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.3)
    **A:** When the autopilot does something the pilot didn't expect because of a mode confusion ("What is it doing now?").
303. **Q:** How can you mitigate the risk of "Get-there-itis"? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** Create a "Plan B" (drive, airline ticket) *before* you leave so you aren't mentally cornered into flying.
304. **Q:** Scenario: You are VFR on top of an overcast layer. You have plenty of fuel. Is this a hazard? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** Yes. The hazard is the cloud layer blocking descent. The risk is getting trapped on top or having to fly IFR without a clearance/rating.
305. **Q:** What is the antidote for "Impulsivity"? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** "Not so fast. Think first."
306. **Q:** Why is it important to brief passengers on safety items? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.3)
    **A:** It turns them into a safety resource (e.g., they can help spot traffic or know not to distract you) rather than a liability.
307. **Q:** Scenario: You are tired after work but want to fly some night landings for currency. Legal? Safe? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** Legal? Probably. Safe? Likely not. Fatigue degrades night vision and coordination. Apply PAVE (Pilot).
308. **Q:** What is "Situational Awareness"? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.3)
    **A:** The accurate perception of operational conditions (where you are, what the plane is doing, what the weather is doing) and potential threats.
309. **Q (Trick):** Can a pilot be "Anti-Authority" if they are following the regulations but ignoring their checklist? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** Yes. Checklists are approved procedures. Ignoring them because "I don't need it" is Anti-Authority.
310. **Q:** How do you handle a distraction (like a door popping open) on takeoff? #humanfactors (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** Fly the airplane first. Do not try to fix it until you are at a safe altitude. (Prioritize Aviate over troubleshoot).

## Construction & Aerodynamics (311-350)
311. **Q:** What is the main disadvantage of monocoque construction? #systems (ACS I.B.K.3)
    **A:** It is very intolerant to damage; a small dent can compromise the structural integrity of the entire component.
312. **Q:** Why do we check rivets on the wing during preflight? #systems (ACS I.B.K.3)
    **A:** Loose or smoking rivets (black residue) indicate movement between skin and structure, suggesting internal damage or overstress.
313. **Q:** What defines the "Angle of Attack"? #aero (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** The angle between the chord line of the wing and the relative wind.
314. **Q:** Does the Critical Angle of Attack change with weight? #aero (ACS PA.VII.A)
    **A:** No. It is a fixed aerodynamic limit of the wing (usually 16-18°).
315. **Q:** In straight and level unaccelerated flight, how do the four forces relate? #aero (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** Lift equals Weight, and Thrust equals Drag. They are in equilibrium.
316. **Q:** Why does a plane turn left during a high-power climb? #aero (ACS PA.I.F)
    **A:** Torque, P-Factor, Spiraling Slipstream, and Gyroscopic Precession.
317. **Q:** Explain P-Factor. #aero (ACS PA.I.F)
    **A:** At high AoA, the descending prop blade creates more thrust than the ascending blade because of its higher relative angle of attack, yawing the plane left.
318. **Q:** What is the first step in spin recovery? #aero (ACS PA.VII.A)
    **A:** Power to Idle. (PARE acronym).
319. **Q:** Why reduce power in a spin? #aero (ACS PA.VII.A)
    **A:** Power can flatten the spin (making recovery harder) and reduces rudder effectiveness due to spiraling slipstream blocking airflow.
320. **Q:** Can an airplane stall at 100 knots? #aero (ACS PA.VII.A)
    **A:** Yes, if the critical angle of attack is exceeded (accelerated stall).
321. **Q:** What is "Ground Effect"? #aero (ACS PA.IV.A)
    **A:** Reduced induced drag when flying within one wingspan of the surface, caused by the interference of the ground with the wingtip vortices.
322. **Q:** What danger does ground effect pose during landing? #aero (ACS PA.IV.A)
    **A:** It causes "floating," which can lead to running out of runway if speed is excessive.
323. **Q:** What is the difference between Static and Dynamic stability? #aero (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** Static is the initial tendency to return to equilibrium. Dynamic is how it behaves over time (damping out oscillations).
324. **Q:** Which stability axis does the elevator control? #aero (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** Longitudinal stability (Pitching around the lateral axis).
325. **Q:** What is "dihedral" and what does it do? #aero (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** The upward angle of the wings. It provides lateral stability (Roll stability) by increasing lift on the low wing during a slip.
326. **Q:** Why does stall speed increase in a turn? #aero (ACS PA.V.A)
    **A:** To maintain altitude in a bank, you must increase total lift to counter centrifugal force. This increases "Load Factor," meaning the wing supports more weight, reaching critical AoA at a higher speed.
327. **Q:** What is the load factor in a 60-degree bank level turn? #aero (ACS PA.V.A)
    **A:** 2 Gs. The effective weight of the aircraft doubles.
328. **Q:** What are the primary flight controls? #systems (ACS I.B.K.3)
    **A:** Ailerons (Roll), Elevator (Pitch), Rudder (Yaw).
329. **Q:** What are secondary flight controls? #systems (ACS I.B.K.3)
    **A:** Flaps and Trim systems.
330. **Q:** How do flaps affect the wing's aerodynamics? #aero (ACS PA.IV.A)
    **A:** They increase camber and chord, increasing both Lift and Drag. This lowers stall speed and allows a steeper approach angle.
331. **Q:** What is "adverse yaw"? #aero (ACS PA.IV.A)
    **A:** When rolling (e.g., left), the up-going wing (right) produces more lift and more induced drag, pulling the nose to the right (opposite the turn).
332. **Q:** How do you counter adverse yaw? #aero (ACS PA.IV.A)
    **A:** Coordinated rudder use (step on the ball).
333. **Q (Trick):** Does lift equal weight in a steady climb? #aero (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** Trick: No. The vertical component of Thrust supports some of the weight, so Lift is slightly less than Weight.
334. **Q:** What is the "Chord Line"? #aero (ACS I.F.K.2)
    **A:** An imaginary straight line connecting the leading and trailing edges of the airfoil.
335. **Q:** Describe "Spiraling Slipstream." #aero (ACS PA.I.F)
    **A:** The corkscrew airflow from the prop strikes the left side of the vertical stabilizer, pushing the tail right and nose left.
336. **Q:** What creates "Wake Turbulence"? #aero (ACS PA.I.F)
    **A:** The generation of lift creates wingtip vortices.
337. **Q:** When is wake turbulence strongest? #aero (ACS PA.I.F)
    **A:** Heavy, Clean, and Slow (e.g., an airliner on takeoff).
338. **Q:** How do you avoid wake turbulence on landing behind a jet? #aero (ACS PA.I.F)
    **A:** Stay above their glidepath and land beyond their touchdown point.
339. **Q:** What is the purpose of the horizontal stabilizer? #aero (ACS I.B.K.3)
    **A:** To provide a downward tail force that balances the nose-heavy tendency of the aircraft (longitudinal stability).
340. **Q:** What happens to stability as the CG moves aft? #aero (ACS PA.VIII.A)
    **A:** Stability decreases. Spin recovery becomes harder. Cruise speed increases (less tail downforce needed).
341. **Q:** What is "Parasite Drag"? #aero (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** Drag caused by the shape/friction of the aircraft moving through air. Increases with the square of airspeed.
342. **Q:** What is "Induced Drag"? #aero (ACS I.F.K.1)
    **A:** Drag created as a byproduct of lift. Highest at low speeds/high AoA.
343. **Q:** What is $V_{Y}$? #performance (ACS PA.I.F)
    **A:** Best Rate of Climb speed (most altitude per unit of time).
344. **Q:** What is $V_{X}$? #performance (ACS PA.I.F)
    **A:** Best Angle of Climb speed (most altitude per unit of distance). Used for obstacle clearance.
345. **Q:** Why does the airplane pitch down during a stall? #aero (ACS PA.VII.A)
    **A:** The center of pressure moves aft, and the loss of downwash on the tail reduces the tail-down force, causing the nose to drop (natural stability).
346. **Q:** What is a "skid" vs. a "slip"? #aero (ACS PA.IV.A)
    **A:** Skid: Rate of turn is too great for the bank (tail swinging outside). Slip: Rate of turn is too low for the bank (tail sliding inside).
347. **Q:** Which is more dangerous in the pattern: a skid or a slip? #aero (ACS PA.VII.A)
    **A:** A skid. If you stall in a skid, the inside wing drops rapidly, leading to a spin entry at low altitude (Base-to-Final turn).
348. **Q:** What are the four types of flaps? #systems (ACS I.B.K.3)
    **A:** Plain, Split, Slotted, and Fowler. (Fowler increases wing area).
349. **Q:** What is "washout" in wing design? #aero (ACS PA.VII.A)
    **A:** A twist in the wing so the root stalls before the tips, maintaining aileron control during the onset of a stall.
350. **Q:** How does density altitude affect aerodynamic performance? #performance (ACS PA.I.F)
    **A:** High density altitude (thin air) reduces lift and engine power, but the *indicated* airspeed for stall/takeoff/landing remains the same.

## Systems & Instruments (351-400)

    **A:** The magneto becomes "hot" (live) and cannot be turned off with the ignition switch.
355. **Q:** Which instruments are part of the Pitot-Static system? #systems (ACS S.V.A)
    **A:** Airspeed Indicator, Altimeter, and Vertical Speed Indicator.
356. **Q:** If the Pitot tube is completely blocked (ram + drain), how does the ASI react? #systems (ACS S.V.A)
    **A:** It acts like an altimeter: showing an increase in speed during a climb and a decrease during a descent.
357. **Q:** What is the difference between a Fowler flap and a Split flap? #systems (ACS I.B.K.3)
    **A:** A Fowler flap slides back to increase wing area (and lift); a Split flap only drops the lower surface to increase drag.
358. **Q:** Explain "UNOS" regarding compass errors. #nav (ACS S.V.C)
    **A:** Undershoot North, Overshoot South. When turning North, the compass lags; when turning South, it leads.

363. **Q:** What does a "discharge" on the ammeter indicate? #systems (ACS S.III.A)
    **A:** The alternator is not carrying the load, and the battery is being drained.
364. **Q:** How do you detect a broken P-lead during the run-up? #systems (ACS S.II.C)
    **A:** When switching to OFF, the engine continues to run (Dead Cut Check).
365. **Q:** What powers the Attitude Indicator? #systems (ACS S.V.B)
    **A:** Usually the vacuum system (suction), though some are electric.
366. **Q:** What powers the Turn Coordinator? #systems (ACS S.V.B)

    **A:** Rigidity in Space and Precession.
368. **Q:** Why does the Heading Indicator need to be reset periodically? #systems (ACS S.V.B)
    **A:** Because of Precession (friction) and the rotation of the Earth, causing it to drift from the magnetic heading.
369. **Q:** What happens to the VSI if the static port is blocked? #systems (ACS S.V.A)
    **A:** It drops to zero and stays there.
370. **Q:** If the static port is blocked, what happens to the Altimeter? #systems (ACS S.V.A)
    **A:** It freezes at the altitude where the blockage occurred.
371. **Q:** How does carburetor heat work? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** It routes unfiltered hot air from around the exhaust shroud into the carburetor to melt ice.
372. **Q:** What happens to engine RPM when you apply carb heat? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** It drops (hot air is less dense -> richer mixture -> less power). If ice is present, it will drop further (melting water) then rise as the engine clears.
373. **Q:** What is the function of the mixture control? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** To adjust the fuel-to-air ratio, compensating for decreased air density at altitude.
374. **Q:** What is "detonation"? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** The explosive, uncontrolled ignition of the fuel/air mixture (instead of a smooth burn). Caused by low grade fuel, high heat, or high power with too lean mixture.
375. **Q:** What is "pre-ignition"? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** The mixture ignites *before* the spark plug fires, usually due to a hot spot (carbon deposit) in the cylinder.
376. **Q:** How do you verify the oil level is sufficient? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** Check the dipstick during preflight (usually 6-8 quarts for a C172).
377. **Q:** What color is 100LL fuel? #systems (ACS S.II.B)
    **A:** Blue.
378. **Q:** What happens if you mix 100LL (Blue) with Jet A (Clear/Straw)? #systems (ACS S.II.B)
    **A:** It can turn clear or invisible, potentially leading to misfueling and catastrophic engine failure (detonation).
379. **Q:** Why are fuel tanks vented? #systems (ACS S.II.B)
    **A:** To allow air to replace the fuel as it is consumed. A blocked vent causes a vacuum that stops fuel flow.
380. **Q:** What is an "auxiliary fuel pump" used for? #systems (ACS S.II.B)
    **A:** Priming the engine or as a backup if the engine-driven pump fails (in low-wing aircraft).
381. **Q:** What type of oil system does your aircraft have? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** Wet Sump (oil is stored in a pan at the bottom of the engine).
382. **Q:** What is the advantage of a fuel injection system over a carburetor? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** No carburetor ice, more precise mixture distribution, and better cold starts.
383. **Q:** Disadvantage of fuel injection? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** Harder to start when hot (vapor lock).
384. **Q:** What does the "Alternate Static Source" do? #systems (ACS S.V.A)
    **A:** Uses air from inside the cabin (lower pressure) to power instruments if the external port is blocked.
385. **Q:** If using Alternate Static, how do the instruments read? #systems (ACS S.V.A)
    **A:** Altimeter reads slightly high; Airspeed reads slightly fast.
386. **Q:** What is the difference between a "Bus" and a "Circuit Breaker"? #systems (ACS S.III.A)
    **A:** The Bus distributes power; the Breaker protects the circuit from overload.
387. **Q:** Can you use an automotive battery in an airplane? #systems (ACS S.III.A)

388. **Q:** What are the indications of an alternator failure in flight? #systems (ACS S.III.A)
    **A:** "Low Volts" annunciator, Zero/Negative indication on the Load Meter/Ammeter.
389. **Q:** Why should you not keep the starter engaged for more than 10-30 seconds? #systems (ACS S.III.A)
    **A:** It overheats the starter motor. It needs a cool-down period.
390. **Q:** What is "vapor lock"? #systems (ACS S.II.B)
    **A:** Fuel vaporizes in the lines (due to heat), blocking liquid fuel from reaching the cylinders.
391. **Q:** How does a cabin heater work in most single-engine pistons? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** A shroud around the exhaust muffler heats ambient air. Danger: Carbon Monoxide leak if muffler cracks.
392. **Q:** What is the purpose of the oil breather? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** To relieve pressure build-up inside the crankcase.
393. **Q:** If your oil pressure is low but temperature is normal, what might it be? #systems (ACS S.II.A)
    **A:** Could be a faulty gauge or pressure relief valve. If temperature rises, it's real—land ASAP.
394. **Q:** What is "magnetic dip"? #nav (ACS S.V.C)
    **A:** The tendency of the compass needle to point down towards the magnetic pole, causing turning errors.
