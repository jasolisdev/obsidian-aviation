# Obsidian Aviation - Enhanced PPL Knowledge Base ✨

Welcome to the enhanced Obsidian Aviation vault! This repository now hosts a comprehensive Private Pilot License (PPL) study guide, meticulously designed to be FAA-aligned, ACS-mapped, and thoroughly checkride-oriented. Building upon the original core reference materials (FAR, AIM, Pilot/Controller Glossary), this vault has evolved into a robust and interactive learning platform for aspiring private pilots.

We've distilled the entire **Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (PHAK - all 17 chapters)** into an accessible, cross-linked study experience within Obsidian.

## 🚀 Key Features & Enhancements

*   **Complete PHAK Integration:** All 17 chapters of the PHAK are transformed into digestible concept notes, organized thematically rather than linearly, for optimal understanding and retention.
*   **ACS Alignment:** Each concept note is explicitly tagged with relevant Airman Certification Standards (ACS) codes, ensuring your study is directly aligned with FAA expectations.
*   **Checkride Focus:** Notes are enriched with "Why it Matters," "Checkride Angle," "Common Mistakes," and practical "Study Drills" to sharpen your knowledge for oral exams and real-world application.
*   **Extensive Oral Exam Question Bank:** A dedicated, searchable section boasting over 500 questions and answers covering all PPL knowledge areas, perfect for rigorous self-testing.
*   **Thematic Organization:** Content is intuitively grouped into categories such as Regulations, Aerodynamics, Aircraft Systems, Weather, Navigation, Human Factors, and Performance/Weight & Balance.
*   **Interactive Diagrams:** Complex concepts are clarified with Mermaid diagrams for visual understanding, including decision flows, system schematics, and aerodynamic principles.
*   **Core Reference Library:** Continue to access up-to-date, cross-linked copies of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), and the Pilot/Controller Glossary – significantly more user-friendly than traditional sources.
