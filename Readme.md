# Obsidian Aviation - Enhanced PPL Knowledge Base

Welcome to the enhanced Obsidian Aviation vault. This repository hosts a comprehensive Private Pilot License (PPL) study guide designed to be FAA-aligned, ACS-mapped, and checkride-oriented for any learner. It builds on core reference materials (FAR, AIM, Pilot/Controller Glossary) and organizes them into practical study workflows.

The vault includes chapter overviews, concept notes, oral-drill material, and binder workflows that students, instructors, and schools can use alongside flight training.

## 🚀 Key Features & Enhancements

*   **Structured PHAK Coverage:** Core PHAK topics are mapped into digestible concept notes organized thematically for retention and review.
*   **ACS Alignment:** Each concept note is explicitly tagged with relevant Airman Certification Standards (ACS) codes, ensuring your study is directly aligned with FAA expectations.
*   **Checkride Focus:** Notes are enriched with "Why it Matters," "Checkride Angle," "Common Mistakes," and practical "Study Drills" to sharpen your knowledge for oral exams and real-world application.
*   **Extensive Oral Exam Question Bank:** A dedicated, searchable section with hundreds of prompts across PPL knowledge areas for self-testing.
*   **Thematic Organization:** Content is intuitively grouped into categories such as Regulations, Aerodynamics, Aircraft Systems, Weather, Navigation, Human Factors, and Performance/Weight & Balance.
*   **Interactive Diagrams:** Complex concepts are clarified with Mermaid diagrams for visual understanding, including decision flows, system schematics, and aerodynamic principles.
*   **Core Reference Library:** Continue to access up-to-date, cross-linked copies of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), and the Pilot/Controller Glossary – significantly more user-friendly than traditional sources.
*   **Current FAA Baseline Tracking:** Includes a dedicated reference note with dated ACS/AIM/chart/handbook checkpoints for maintaining currency.
