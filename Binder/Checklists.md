# Checklists & Flows

## Standard flows
- Keep preflight, run-up, takeoff, cruise, and landing flows as linked notes here so you can narrate each step during the oral/flight.
- Copy one of the [[PPL-Knowledge-Base/Templates/Concept Note|concept note templates]] to start a checklist-style note, or create a new `Checklist` template.

## Emergency & abnormal procedures
- Document on-the-fly notes (engine failure, electrical problems, lost comms) and link them to the appropriate FAR/AIM entries in the [[Binder/Regulations|Regulations]] section.
- Keep an `EmergencyFlows.md` note inside this binder section (create it now if needed) and reference [[AIM/06 Emergency Procedures|AIM emergency procedures]].

## Quick-review items
- Build a `Preflight-Checklist` note that lists weight & balance, fuel, crew briefings, weather, NOTAMs, and autop checks.
- Link each checklist item back to the source so you can defend it during the check ride (FAR, AIM, or your POH).
