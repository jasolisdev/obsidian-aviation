# Check Ride Binder

This is the binder view of the vault: five tabs that mirror the physical checklist binder your instructor or DPE would use.

## First before each checkride prep session
- [[PPL-Knowledge-Base/00-Study-Plan/Ultimate-PPL-Study-Guide|Ultimate PPL Study Guide]]
- [[PPL-Knowledge-Base/00-Study-Plan/Study-Track-Selector|Study Track Selector]]
- [[PPL-Knowledge-Base/00-Study-Plan/FAA-Current-References-2026|FAA Current References (2026 Baseline)]]

## Binder tabs
- [[Binder/Regulations|Regulations & Requirements]] – quick access to FAR/AIM, currency, endorsements, and the regulations concept index.
- [[Binder/Aircraft-Documents|Aircraft & Equipment Documents]] – POH/AFM references, weight & balance, and glossary/pdf references that stay with the training aircraft.
- [[Binder/Mission-Planning|Mission Planning & Weather]] – charts, ATC procedures, and aviation weather references pulled from AIM and the knowledge base.
- [[Binder/Checklists|Checklists & Flows]] – preflight, takeoff, and emergency checklists plus links to templates that keep the flows consistent.
- [[Binder/Oral-Prep|Oral Exam Prep]] – oral drill notes, scenario prompts, and the oral exam folder in the knowledge base.
