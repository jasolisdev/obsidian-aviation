# Oral Exam Prep

## Oral QA bank
- [[PPL-Knowledge-Base/08-Oral-Exam|Oral exam folder]] with scenario drills, ACS references, and prompt decks.
- [[PPL-Knowledge-Base/08-Oral-Exam/Oral-QA|Oral QA bank]] for question/answer practice.
## Scenario practice
- [[PPL-Knowledge-Base/08-Oral-Exam/Trick-Questions|Trick questions]] note to highlight things that can trip you up.
- Keep 5–7 scenario cards (e.g., weather diversion, night maneuvering, ATC reroute) as notes in this section and tag them for quick review.
- Link each scenario to underlying regs (FAR/AIM) from [[Binder/Regulations|the regulations tab]].

## Self-grading journal
- Maintain a note here tracking what topics you reviewed, what questions tripped you up, and what you want to drill again before the check ride.
