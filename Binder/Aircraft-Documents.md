# Aircraft & Equipment Documents

## PDFs and POHs
- Drop POH/AFM files, performance charts, and FAA-supplied PDFs into `PPL-Knowledge-Base/PDFs/` so they stay accessible during oral prep and flight planning.
- [[PPL-Knowledge-Base/PDFs/00-Place-PDFs-Here|PDF folder instructions]] and the binder can keep them synchronized.

## Glossaries & reference letters
- [[Pilot Controller Glossary/0 Index|Pilot/Controller Glossary index]] – alphabetic definitions for ATC/aircraft terms you reference during the oral.
- Peer through [[Pilot Controller Glossary/A|A]] through [[Pilot Controller Glossary/W|W]] files as needed for quick definitions.

## Weight & balance / performance prep
- Keep a note here with current training-aircraft weight & balance numbers (create a new note inside this section or paste the latest form as needed).
