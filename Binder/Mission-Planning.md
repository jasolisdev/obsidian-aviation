## Weather & performance planning
- [[AIM/07 Safety of Flight|AIM weather & safety]] to review briefing procedures, ADM, risk management, and weather limitations.
- [[PPL-Knowledge-Base/04-Weather|PPL KB weather folder]] for detailed forecasts, Go/No-Go trees, and decision guides.
- [[02-Aerodynamics/Concepts-Notes|Aerodynamics concept notes]] for lift/drag, energy management, and crosswind handling.

## Charts, airspace, and procedures
- [[AIM/03 Airspace|Airspace]] and [[AIM/09 Aeronautical Charts and Related Publications|charts]] sections to prep for airspace, altitudes, and chart symbols.
- [[AIM/04 Air Traffic Control|ATC procedures]] plus [[AIM/05 Air Traffic Procedures|communications]] to rehearse phraseology and clearance flows.
- [[PPL-Knowledge-Base/05-Navigation|Navigation notes]] for GPS, VOR, and pilotage/drift techniques in one place.
